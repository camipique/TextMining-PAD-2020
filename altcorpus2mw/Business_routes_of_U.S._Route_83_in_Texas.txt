Business routes of U.S. Route 83 in Texas &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& There are currently three '''business routes of U.S. Route 83 in Texas''' that are designated and maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The business routes in the US state of Texas are traditionally short spurs or loops that connect the main route, in this case, U.S. Route  83 (US 83), to the center or commercial district of a city. The routes commonly follow the course of an decommissioned state highway, or the old course of the main route. Business routes are signed with the traditional US 83 highway shield, and with a small "business plate" placed above the marker. TxDOT regards business routes as official highways, and is responsible for the maintenance of the route. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Abilene &&&&& &&&&& '''Business US Route 83-D''' ('''Bus. US 83-D''') is a business loop of US 83 that passes through Abilene. &&&&& &&&&& Bus. US 83-D begins at an interchange with US 83 / US 84 / Loop 322 near Kibry Lake. The highway travels in a northern direction along Treadwaway Boulevard through an industrial area of the city, seeing more development along its route north of Industrial Boulevard. Bus. US 83-D travels in a northeast direction between Jeanette Street and South 14th Street, intersects SH 36, then has a short overlap with BL I-20 near downtown. The highway travels just east of the city's downtown area through a large commercial area, with development along the route decreasing north of SH 351 near Hardin-Simmons University.

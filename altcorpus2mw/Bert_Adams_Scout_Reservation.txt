Bert Adams Scout Reservation &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Bert Adams Scout Reservation''' is a long-term overnight camp owned and operated by the Atlanta Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Bert Adams is located south of Covington, Georgia, situated on Lake Bulow Campbell; the camp is one of three major BSA summer camps in the Atlanta Area Council. The reservation is named after Albert S. "Bert" Adams, a "beloved leader in the city of Atlanta", and the president of what was then called the "Atlanta Council of the Boy Scouts", during the 1920s. &&&&& &&&&& Bert Adams has consistently been listed as one of the best scout camps in the United States by Boys Life and Scouting Magazines. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& === Camp Friendly === &&&&& Early proposals for a new summer camp in the council began as early as summer of 1916, however, the United States entry into World War I delayed any potential progress on these proposals. After the war concluded, one of the original proposers of a new summer camp, Mr. Roland Shine, directed a temporary summer camp, Camp Friendly, which acted as a placeholder until a new permanent camp could be established. After some time, though "successful as a summer event", Camp Friendly, did not fully meet the needs and goals of the council, and was cancelled after its 1922 season. &&&&& &&&&& === First Permanent Camp === &&&&& &&&&& ==== Construction ==== &&&&& After the closing of Camp Friendly, a representative of the council and advocator for the building of a new summer camp, Richard Darby, began the search for a location for a permament camp. The property he settled upon was located in Vinings, about 11 miles (17.7 Kilometers) north of Atlanta. The plats the site was located on then were then purchased one by one by Albert "Bert" Adams (the president of the Atlanta Area Council, and the later namesake of the camp) and the Adams-Cates Realty Company, and began the building of the camp. After the land purchase was completed, sporadic and unorganized construction of the camp began shortly after. A dam was constructed on a creek running through the property, with the resulting 1.3 acre lake being named after Richard Darby, in recognition of his work in championing the idea of building a new camp. Though parts of the camp were still being built at the time, the core of the camp began welcoming scouts in the autumn of 1925. &&&&& &&&&& Much to the sadness of the council and Scouters throughout Central and North Georgia, Albert "Bert" Adams died in December 1926, before the construction on the camp could be completed. Shortly thereafter, Chairman Law of the Atlanta Area Council Executive Board proposed that the new camp, once completed, be named in his honor. The proposal was approved by the Council Executive Board unanimously. &&&&& &&&&& Due to Adams' death, financial troubles early on, and the slow and relatively unorganized rate of construction, the completion of the building of the camp missed its summer of 1926 deadline. A large campaign in order to raise the remaining $75,000 1926 USD (the equivalent of $1.08 Million USD in 2018), began in February 1927. The campaign was hugely successful and its goal was met in April 3 of that same year. On April 3, 1927, a groundbreaking ceremony for what would become the main structure of the camp, a 60 x 100 foot (~19 x 33 meters) dining hall, was conducted by the son of Albert Adams, Life Scout Albert S. Adams Jr. &&&&& &&&&& ==== Dedication ==== &&&&& On June 11, 1927, the camp was officially dedicated and opening with a grand opening ceremony. Many of the general public from cities throughout the Atlanta area were in attendance. Among guests of particular note would include, Governor Clifford Walker, Atlanta Mayor I.N. Ragsdale, and Chief Scout Executive James E. West. In his address, Mr. West indicated that Atlanta was one of only a few councils at that time to own any overnight camping facilities. &&&&& &&&&& ==== Relocation ==== &&&&& The camp continued operation at that site for 33 years, until 1960, when a new larger site was found, and moved to. &&&&& &&&&& === Current Permament Camp === &&&&& Following the 1960 summer season, with the original camp facilities growing old and falling to disrepair, a new site was chosen just south of Covington, Georgia. This site has been the location of the camp since that time. &&&&& &&&&& '''2018 Accident''' &&&&& &&&&& On July 25, 2018, a severe weather storm came into the camp. Elijah Knight (14 at the time), was in his tent playing cards with 2 of his friends. Elijah was never told to go take shelter, so they stayed in their tent. Minutes later, a tree came crashing down on their tent, crushing Elijah. The other 2 boys escaped unharmed. Elijah was found dead just minutes after. It appeared that the tree fell right down on Elijahâ€™s head. Help was on the way, but no one could save him. &&&&& &&&&& Climate &&&&& === Weather === &&&&& &&&&& Due to the camp's location in the North Georgia region of the American South, the camp often sees moderate to severe weather. This particularly includes thunderstorms and rain. In order to counter this, the council has several safety precautions and campwide alarms in place in an attempt to prevent incident. &&&&& &&&&& In June 2018, there was an incident where a Scout was killed as a result of a tree falling on the Scout's tent after severe storm force winds pushed the tree down. &&&&& &&&&& === Fauna === &&&&& An American Copperhead (this picture taken particularly at the entrance to the camp) &&&&& The camp is a native home to many of the same animals that are native to both Central and North Georgia. In the case of land animals, this includes, but is not limited to: Brown Bears, White Tailed Deer, American Copperhead, and the Cottonmouth. Deer are particularly prevalent, and can be found once or twice in any given week. In addition, the lake, Lake Bulow Campbell is home to several species of freshwater fish. Fishing is allowed on a catch-and-release practice. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

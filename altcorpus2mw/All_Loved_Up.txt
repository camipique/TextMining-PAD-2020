All Loved Up &&&&& Introduction &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& "'''All Loved Up'''" is a song recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Amy Shark.

On 21 August 2018, Shark performed an acoustic version on Triple M. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Lyrically, the song has been compared to the work of Bruce Springsteen. &&&&& &&&&& Cameron Adams from ''Herald Sun'', in an album review said "Jack Antonoff transports Shark into his '80s soundtrack world with "All Loved Up" — it's a Bleachers-style muted banger." &&&&& &&&&& Jonathan Robles from ''Variance Magazine'', in an album review called "All Loved Up" "simply perfect". Adding "It's bursting with that pulsating, windows-down-on-the-freeway energy reminiscent of fellow high-speed cuts such as Taylor Swift's "Out of the Woods", Lorde's "Green Light" and Bleachers' own "Rollercoaster"." &&&&& &&&&& Isabella Trimboli from ''The Guardian'' said "All Loved Up" was "a clear standout" and said "it bears all the trappings of an Antonoff song: 80s-inspired instrumentation, thudding bass and a soaring, melodic chorus. Lyric-wise, it plays on Bruce Springsteen-reminiscent tropes of small town/big dreams". &&&&& &&&&& Music Video &&&&& The music video was shot in Los Angeles and was directed by David O'Donohue and produced by Felicity Jayn Heath. &&&&& &&&&& ==Track listing==  &&&&& # "All Loved Up" – 3:30 &&&&& &&&&& ==Charts== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Australia (ARIA) &&&&& &&&&& 58 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Certifications &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ==Release history== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Country &&&&& &&&&& Date &&&&& &&&&& Format &&&&& &&&&& Label &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Australia &&&&& &&&&& 3 August 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Contemporary hit radio &&&&& &&&&& Wonderlick, Sony Music Australia &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ==References== &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

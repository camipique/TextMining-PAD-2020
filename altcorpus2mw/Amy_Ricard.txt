On the Boston stage, with her husband Lester Lonergan, she starred in ''An Idyl of Erin'' (1910). &&&&& &&&&& Dorothy Parker wrote of ''The Woman on the Index'' in ''Vanity Fair'', saying "The thing was so well done. You know yourself that with a cast including Julia Dean, Amy Ricard, and Lester Lonergan, you can't really have such a terrible evening." &&&&& &&&&& Amy Ricard made her political views in favor of women's suffrage public, wearing a "Votes for Women" pin and speaking at suffrage events in New York City. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Amy Ricard's engagement to poet and editor Charles Hanson Towne was announced in 1908, but she married Irish actor and playwright Lester Lonergan, as his third wife, in 1909.

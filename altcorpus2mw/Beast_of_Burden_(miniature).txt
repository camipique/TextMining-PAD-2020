Barton reviewed ''Beast of Burden'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 47. Barton commented that "Overall, ''Beast of Burden'' will probably prove of more use in your ''Traveller'' miniature animal encounters than those figures in the earlier ''Aliens'' pack. I'd recommend adding at least one or two to your collection." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

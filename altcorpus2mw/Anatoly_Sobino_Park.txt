Anatoly Sobino Park &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Anatoly Sabino Park''' () is a park in Zheleznodorozhny District of Rostov-on-Don. It is named after Russian revolutionary Anatoly Sobino, who is buried at its territory. &&&&& &&&&& History and description &&&&& Before the park was established, at its territory had been Lengorod Garden, which was considered the main park of Zatemernitsky Settlement, a historical part of Rostov-on-Don. &&&&& &&&&& In times of the Soviet Union, the park was a small piece of greenery. There also was a Ferris wheel, children's attractions, a summer stage, an open-air cinema and a planetarium. &&&&& &&&&& In the 21st century, many structures in the came to the state of disrepair and required to be restored. At the whole territory there are fragments of old buildings, among them â€” remains of the summer stage, which is surrounded by bricks and building blocks, as well as by a brick wall. Most of the benches were broken as well as the sidewalks. Rostov-on-Don dwellers usually call this park "''skvernyi skver''" (ugly square in English). &&&&& &&&&& In 2006 the park was granted the status of a square. The territory underwent some changes: the trees in emergent condition were cut off, dilapidated buildings were partly demolished. In 2014 the park was again partly landscaped. &&&&& &&&&& In December 2017 an Orthodox chapel constructed at the territory of the park, which was meant to be transformed into a church, was a subject of arson. It is presumed that the arson was committed by some of the local residents who were hostile to the idea of construction of a new chapel in the city district. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

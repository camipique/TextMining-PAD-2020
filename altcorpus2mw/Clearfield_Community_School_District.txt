Clearfield Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Clearfield Community School District''' was a school district headquartered in Clearfield, Iowa. It operated one school: Clearfield Community School. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014 the district had a total of 27 students. &&&&& &&&&& Due to a declining financial situation, the district leadership attempted to find another school district willing to do a consolidation, but it could not find a willing merger partner. The voters approved a proposal to dissolve the district. Four other school districts absorbed pieces of the Clearfield district: Bedford, Diagonal, Lenox, and Mt Ayr. The dissolution was effective July 1, 2014. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Clearfield Community School District &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

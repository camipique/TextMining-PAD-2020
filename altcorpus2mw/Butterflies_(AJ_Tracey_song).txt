It's all cool listening to the afrobeats and afroswing, whatever you want to call it, but where is the dancehall, the soca, you know what I'm saying? There's none of this in U.K. music. I just wanted to showcase it a bit." &&&&& &&&&& Music video &&&&& The music video was released on 30 May 2018. It was directed by Tracey himself along with Mornix.

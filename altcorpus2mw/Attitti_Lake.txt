Attitti Lake &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Attitti Lake''' is a lake in Saskatchewan, Canada. It lies in low-relief forested terrain of the Canadian Shield. The climate is sub-arctic. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& &&&&& Attitti Lake is at , at an elevation of . &&&&& The lake is northwest of Flin Flon, Manitoba and about east of Pelican Narrows, Saskatchewan. &&&&& It is connected by a winter road with Kakinagimak Lake, Wildnest Lake and Hanson Lake highway (106), which runs south of Wildnest Lake. &&&&& It can be reached by canoe from Pelican Narrows via Wunehikun Bay and Waskwei Lake, and is connected to most of the surrounding lakes by well-maintained portages. &&&&& &&&&& Terrain &&&&& &&&&& The area is typical of the flat-surfaced part of the Canadian Shield, with low hills that rarely rise as much as above the lakes. &&&&& The terrain consists of roughly parallel sinuous ridges of outcrop separated by muskeg, drift and lakes. &&&&& The channel that connects Attitti Bay with Attitti Lake is underlain by a north-trending fault zone. &&&&& Geologically the area is in the Precambrian Kisseynew complex, underlain by an assemblage of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks that has been intricately folded, with intrusions of sill-like granitic bodies. &&&&& Metamorphism in the area appears to have peaked about 1807 million years ago. &&&&& There is significant economic potential for volcanogenic massive sulfide and gold mineralization. &&&&& &&&&& The area has parts of three different drainage basins. &&&&& Robbestad Lake, McArthur Lake and the northern part of Kakinagimak Lake drain northward into the Churchill River via the Nemei River. &&&&& The southern part of Kakinagimak Lake, and Dezort Lake, Dougherty Lake, Wildnest Lake, and Pearson Lake drain south into the Wildnest-Sturgeon-Weir River System, then into the Saskatchewan River. &&&&& The rest of the area drains into Attitti Lake, which drains eastward through Waskwei Lake, Wunehikun Bay, Mirond Lake and the Sturgeon-Weir River System into the Saskatchewan River System. &&&&& &&&&& Environment &&&&& &&&&& The lake is in the subarctic climate zone. &&&&& The annual average temperature is . &&&&& The warmest month is July, when the average temperature is and the coldest is January, with . &&&&& The lake is surrounded by coniferous forest. &&&&& The trees are mainly black spruce (''Picea mariana''), jack pine (''Pinus banksiana''), poplar (''populus'') and scattered balsam (''populus balsamifera''). &&&&& Trees average more than in height. &&&&& There are small patches of moss-covered muskeg that support laurel (''kalmia microphylla''), labrador tea, and scattered larch and black spruce. &&&&& &&&&& Animals hunted for meat or fur include moose, woodland cariboo, black bear, beaver, otter and muskrat. &&&&& Spruce partridge are common. &&&&& There is a fly-in fishing lodge on the lake, which has a good population of lake trout, northern pike and walleye. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

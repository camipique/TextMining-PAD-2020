Cochinchina is the southernmost province, south of Cambodia. &&&&& From 1884 the French were engaged in a war of pacification in the protectorate of Cambodia, to the north of the colony of Cochinchina. &&&&& The climate is harsh, with torrential rainfall from May to October, and diseases such as dysentery, cholera and malaria were endemic. &&&&& Filippini's predecessors had allowed the troops to rape, loot and kill peasants whom they suspected of supporting the rebels, and had sanctioned collective punishments and summary executions. &&&&& The whole population had been turned against the French occupiers. &&&&& Filippini was appointed to implement a less brutal policy. &&&&& &&&&& Filippini was civilian Governor of Cochinchina from 19 June 1886 to 22 October 1887. &&&&& He was sent to replace Charles Thomson, who had been succeeded by Charles Auguste Frédéric Bégin as acting governor. &&&&& Filippini obtained permission from his superiors to negotiate a settlement with King Norodom of Cambodia in which the French respected the autonomy of the king's administration and cut back the number of French officials in the kingdom. &&&&& In return, Norodom called for a ceasefire and arranged a general amnesty for the rebels. &&&&& The main rebel commanders had ceased fighting by the end of the year. &&&&& Filippini managed to restore some of France's influence in Cambodia. &&&&& &&&&& The Indo-Chinese Union was established by the decrees of October 1887. &&&&& The colony of Cochinchina and the protectorates of Cambodia, Tonkin and Annam now came under the overall authority of the Governor-General of Indo-China. &&&&& The climate had proved too much for Filippini. &&&&& He died in Saigon, Cochinchina, on 22 October 1887. &&&&& He was 52 years old. &&&&& On 23 October 1887 he was replaced by Noël Pardon as Acting Governor. &&&&& Filippini's body was returned to Corte and placed in a catafalque within an imposing tomb erected after a national subscription. &&&&& It was discovered in 1989 that the coffin and Filippini's body had been completely destroyed by fire, and only the medallion on the coffin remained. &&&&& &&&&& Publications &&&&& &&&&& Publications by Filippini include: &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

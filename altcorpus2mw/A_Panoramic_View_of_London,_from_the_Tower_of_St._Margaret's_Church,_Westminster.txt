It is particularly significant for its depiction of the pre-1834 Palace of Westminster. &&&&& &&&&& Creation &&&&& &&&&& Section of the work showing the Palace of Westminster, with Westminster Bridge crossing the River Thames in the background &&&&& &&&&& The work uses watercolour and bodycolour over pencil, on paper, which has been mounted on canvass. It is long. It is a sketch for a larger work, now lost, which was displayed as a visitor attraction in Paris. That work was long (or in diameter; sources vary). &&&&& &&&&& Depictions &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& St. Margaret's, seen here in 2016, was Prévost's vantage point &&&&& &&&&& Prévost painted the view from the tower of St. Margaret's, including (from left to right): &&&&& &&&&& * Westminster Abbey (part) &&&&& * Guildhall &&&&& * Whitehall &&&&& * St Martin-in-the-Fields &&&&& * St James's Park &&&&& * Banqueting House &&&&& * River Thames &&&&& * Waterloo Bridge (under construction) &&&&& * St Paul's Cathedral &&&&& * Westminster Bridge &&&&& * Palace of Westminster &&&&& * Westminster Abbey &&&&& &&&&& This was before the 1834 fire which destroyed much of the Palace of Westminster; and the Palace's subsequent rebuilding. &&&&& &&&&& Provenance &&&&& &&&&& On 4 July 2018, the painting was auctioned at Sotheby's in London, after being re-found in the south of France. It was purchased for £250,000 by the Museum of London, with partial funding by the Art Fund. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Shrivastava started fighting to capture the union and its office situated in sector-3 of Bokaro. Consequently, the matter went to court and the office was locked. Then H.C.L. Shrivastava made his other group of the union with the same name and claimed his group as a real Bokaro Steel Worker's Union (BSWU) on August 1990 claiming Parmanand Tripathi had made a fake list of office bearers. Both considered Dubey as their leaders but he had to be on one side so he chose Tripathi. &&&&& One more incident took place when Virendra Choubey made his own group to separate himself from Chandrashekhar Dubey. Both claimed their Union as the real one. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

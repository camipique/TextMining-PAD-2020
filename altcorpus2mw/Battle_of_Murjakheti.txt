Battle of Murjakheti &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Battle of Murjakheti''' was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Imereti and the Principality of Samtskhe at the place of Murjakheti near Akhalkalaki, on 12 August 1535. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& During Qvarqvare III's reign Persian influence on Samtskhe was growing day by day. Because of that Ottomans greatly damaged the country and especially it's southwestern region. Meskhetian lords had recognized that under Qvarqvare's rule Samtskhe would finally turn to the Enemy's hands. They made an alliance with the Georgian kings, Bagrat III of Imereti and Luarsab I of Kartli (1510â€“1565) to end up Jaqelian rule and protect Samtskhe from dominant Muslim empires (Ottomans and Safavids). &&&&& &&&&& In 1535 King Bagrat III with help of prince Rostom Gurieli and Odishian allies invaded Samtskhe. He defeated and captured Qvarqvare III at the Battle of Murjakheti near Akhalkalaki, the atabag was captured by Gurieli's cup-bearer Isak Artumeladze, and eventually delivered to Bagrat. Georgians had annexed Principality of Samtskhe. Qvarqvare died in prison, while Rostom was awarded his share of Samtskhe: Adjara and Lazeti, long sought after by the Gurieli dynasty. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& A few years later, Qvarqvare's survived youngest son Kaikhosro II requested Ottomans to expel Imeretian and Kartlian forces from Samtskhe. The Ottomans retaliated with a major invasion: Bagrat and Rostom were victorious at Karagak in 1543, but decisively defeated, in 1545, at Sokhoista, where Rostom's son Kaikhosro was killed. &&&&& &&&&& Samtskhe became vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Qvarqvare III's descendants ruled Samtskhe-Saatabago (until 1628) and then Childir Eyalet until 1820s. Thus, the Georgian regions of Samtskhe, Adjara, and Lazeti remained under Ottoman dominance for the next three centuries. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

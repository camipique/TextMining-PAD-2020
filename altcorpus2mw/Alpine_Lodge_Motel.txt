It was subsequently converted to guesthouse accommodation. In 1893, Rogers conjoined and renovated the terraces as the Temperance movement '''Metropolitan Coffee Palace''', operated by Mr. W. Fry (also known as '''Fry's Coffee Palace'''). It continued in operation as a coffee palace under successive owners, later known as '''Field's Coffee Palace''' and '''Stock's Coffee Palace''' until at least 1911. One of the four terraces was later demolished. It was converted to modern motel accommodation in the 1990s. &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& Alpine Lodge Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& === Attribution === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

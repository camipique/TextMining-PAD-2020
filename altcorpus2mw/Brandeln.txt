Brandeln &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio: ''The Card Cheat'' (painted c. 1594) &&&&& Georges de la Tour: ''The Card Cheat with the Ace of Diamonds'' &&&&& Gerrit van Honthorst: ''The Card Cheat'' &&&&& '''Brandeln''', sometimes Anglicized as '''Brandle''', is an historical card game for four players in which three play against a soloist. It is still played in Germany today. &&&&& Rules &&&&& === Cards === &&&&& The game is played with 28 cards from a 32-card deck of French playing cards with the Eights removed. &&&&& &&&&& === Ranking === &&&&& In the trump suit the Jack (''Bube'') and the Seven are the highest trumps; the ranking runs thus: &&&&& &&&&& Jack > Seven > Ace > King > Queen (''Dame'') > Ten > Nine &&&&& &&&&& In the other suits the ranking of card values for taking tricks is the usual: &&&&& &&&&& Ace > King > Queen > Jack > Ten > Nine > Seven &&&&& &&&&& === Preparation === &&&&& Seating and dealing is as per normal. Dealing, bidding and playing are all in clockwise order. Each player is dealt seven cards in packets of two, three and two again. &&&&& &&&&& === Bidding === &&&&& The player to the left of the dealer is forehand and the first to bid. &&&&& &&&&& *If he believes he can win three tricks in one of the four suits, which then become trumps, he says "Brandle" (''"Ein Brandel"'') or "I'll brandle" (''"Ich brandle"''). &&&&& &&&&& *If he passes, bidding passes to the second, third and fourth players. &&&&& &&&&& The bidder can also be outbid by 4, 5, 6 tricks, but can play the Brandel by which he is outbid, himself. &&&&& &&&&& The player does not announce the suit in which he intends to "brandle" until he has won the auction. &&&&& &&&&& If a player call a Bettel ("Beggar"), he is offering not to take any tricks. A Bettel beats a 6-trick Brandel. &&&&& &&&&& The highest contract, which beats all the others, is Mord, which is where a player has to take all 7 tricks. &&&&& &&&&& === Playing === &&&&& The player who has announced the highest bid wins the auction and leads to the first trick. &&&&& &&&&& Players must follow suit or, if not able to, play a trump. In a Bettel contract, in which there are no trumps, players must play a higher card if they can. &&&&& &&&&& === Scoring === &&&&& Points for winning are awarded as follows: &&&&& &&&&& * 3-trick Brandel - 3 points &&&&& * 4-trick Brandel - 4 points &&&&& * 5-trick Brandel - 5 points &&&&& * 6-trick Brandel - 6 points &&&&& * Bettel - 7 points &&&&& * Mord - 8 points &&&&& &&&&& If the declarer (the winner of the auction) loses, he pays the 3 defenders the same amount each. &&&&& &&&&& Over- and under-tricking does not count. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Literature &&&&& * _ (1983).

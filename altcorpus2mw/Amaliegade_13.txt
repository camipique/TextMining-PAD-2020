Amaliegade 13 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Amaliegade 13''' is a historic property in the Frederiksstaden Quarter of central Copenhagen, Denmark. Originally atenement houses, it was later converted into the city home of count Frederik Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& ===Niels Gundersen and Andreas Lund=== &&&&& The undeveloped lot was acquired by Niels Gundersen Lund on 29 April 1750. It was 30 alen wide and 131 alen deep. Gundersen's plans for the site comprised a seven bay, three-storey building facing the street, a 10-bay side wing and a 15-bay rear wing. The two half-timbered rear wings had almost been completed by June 1751 but the construction of the main wing was delayed for economic reasons. In a letter to the king dated 7 December 1753, Gundersen applied for permission to build a brewery at the site. Alternatively, he offered to build a rectory at the site if the king would appoint his son to pastor at the new Frederick's Church that was planned in the area. The application for permission to open a brewery was rejected on 25 February 1865 and the request of a priesthood for his son seems to have simply been ignored. It is unclear whether construction of the building had commenced when Gundersen died later that same year but it was completed by his son in 1755. &&&&& &&&&& Lund used the complex as a tenement houses. The building fronting the street contained two apartments on each floor. The 14-bay cross wing which had been built by Lund's father contained four apartments on each floor. A 10-bay single-storey rear wing with Mansard roof was completed in 1761. It contained stabling for six forses and remises for two carriages in the ground floor. &&&&& &&&&& In 1762, around one hundred people lived in the complex. Lund, who also owned a property in Pilestræde, lived with his family in one of the apartments in the ground floor of the cross wing. Anna Fischer,whose husband, Admiral Olfert Fas Fischer, gad died the previous year, lived with her nine children, two maids and a servant in the two apartments on the first floor of the main wing. One of the children was the then 16 years old navel cadet Olfert Fischer. &&&&& &&&&& ===Danneskiold-Samsøe, Meincke and Fix=== &&&&& Frederik Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe &&&&& On 17 December 1763, Lund sold the property to Postmaster-General Frederik Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe (1722-1778) who immediately converted it into a suitable townhouse. The Mezzaninewas heightened into a full floor and the saddle roof was replaced by a Mansard roof. Danneskiold-Samsøe's residence was located on the first and second floors, the attick contained the maids' rooms and the kitchen was located in the basement. The ground floor was a separate apartment which was wither rented out or put at the disposal of a member of the family. The rear wing with apartments and the stable wing were demolished and two six-bay side wings were built in their place. The one to the let contained stabling for seven horses, a remise for a single carriage and two toilets. The one to the right contained a remise and storage space for firewood. &&&&& &&&&& Danneskiold-Samsøe died on 26 March 1778 in Copenhagen. His widow kept the house in Amaliegade for a couple of years but sold it to Lorentz Angel Meincke on 23 March 1782 for 16,000 Danish rigsdaler. &&&&& &&&&& Johan Leonhard Fix (1735-1807) purchased the building in 1787. He just moved to Copenhagen after serving as governor of Danish India. &&&&& &&&&& ===Conversion into apartments=== &&&&& Fix died on 2 February 1807. Harald cib Rothe (1781-1848), a son-inb-law, acquired Amaliegade 13 in auction on 8 May that same year. He was an artillery captain and already the owner of the estate Aggersvold. He converted the property in Amaliegade into three high-end apartments. A new side wing with kitchen facilities was constructed. Rothe sold the property to merchant Johan Gregorius Veith before the renovation had been completed in 1809 but with a ten-year lease on some of the rooms. J. D.

His widow sold the property in 1847 but lived in the apartment on the ground floor until her death in 1850. In 1845, 83 years old Joachim Dietrich Brandis,the queen's physician, had returned to the building. He now lived in the apartment on the first floor with his 30 years younger wif, their two children.

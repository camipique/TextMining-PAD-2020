Bentinck Street Elm Trees &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bentinck Street Elm Trees''' is a heritage-listed row of street trees at Bentinck Street, Bathurst, Bathurst Region, New South Wales, Australia. The property is owned by Bathurst Regional Council (Local Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& The Bentinck Street elms were planted around 1904 and later pollarded. &&&&& &&&&& English elms were favoured/ planted between and - corresponding with the date of Bentinck Street's elms. Elms are a defining tree of the ('Federation') era in Bathurst and a number of inland Australian and NSW country towns of this period (e.g.: Ballarat, Bendigo, Albury, Orange, Wagga Wagga). They were a favoured species of street tree in the second Municipal Street Tree Period in NSW (-1920). Key Bathurst parks such as Machattie Park, and "competing" parks such as Robertson and Cook Parks, Orange all feature magnificent, mature English elms. &&&&& &&&&& It is significant that downtown Bathurst is characterised by mature elms - as is its chief historical rival, downtown Goulburn. These are the two major early inland cities of NSW. &&&&& &&&&& In 1984 the Bathurst Action Committee to Secure Unified Planning (BACSUP) contacted the Heritage Council in regard to a proposed 7 lane roadway traffice enhancement scheme that would lead to the removal of 20 elm trees along Bentick Street. &&&&& &&&&& After discussions and meetings with Bathurst Council and consideration of the trees streetscape and historic significance a section 136 Order was signed and placed on 16 trees on 22 August 1994. &&&&& &&&&& At the 6 September 1984 Heritage Council meeting, Bathurst Council presented a detailed submission and discussed alternative solutions to the proposed 7 lane roadway. The Heritage Council resolved to engage an independent consultant acceptable to both the Heritage Council and Bathurst City Council to provide advice on alternative road reconstruction proposals, with consideration of the heritage value of the street trees. The Heritage Council also resolved to recommend to the Minister the making of an Interim Conservation Order be placed over the trees. The Order was gazetted on 14 September 1984. &&&&& &&&&& In late 1984 three separate section 60 applications were subsequently received. One application was to remove all 16 trees, the second to undercut the trees to a clearance of 5.3 metres and the third to trim the trees. After consideration the Heritage Council resolved to approve the removal of trees on the western side of Bentinck street, approve undercutting to a maximum height of 4.8 metres above the road and approve the application to trim the trees. &&&&& &&&&& At its meeting of 6 December 1984 the Heritage Council resolved that it considered it necessary to ensure the trees' future to recommend to the Minister that a Permanent Conservation Order be placed on the 16 elm trees. &&&&& &&&&& An exemption under section 57(2) of the Heritage Actwas approved in for periodic regravelling, emergency and routine work to water mains and electrical installations and routine pruning. &&&&& &&&&& A Permanent Conservation Order was placed on 16 August 1985. The trees were transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 (Heritage Office files). &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Bentinck Street Elm Trees, late winter 2018 &&&&& The Bentinck Street English elms (''Ulmus procera)'' form a healthy, evenly spaced avenue of trees of uniform growth to a height of approximately 9-12 metres.

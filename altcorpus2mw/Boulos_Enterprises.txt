Boulos Enterprises &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Boulos Enterprises''' is Nigeria's largest assembler and distributor of motorcycles in Nigeria. The company was incorporated in Nigeria in 1964. A family business, it was established by Anthony and Gabriel Boulos. &&&&& &&&&& The firm has a history of motorcycle and tricycle assembly in Nigeria. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Boulos' history began in Lagos as a store that sells jewellery and other small articles to the upper middle class in Lagos. The jewellery business was managed by George Boulos, a Lebanese goldsmith who immigrated to Nigeria in 1936, George developed good relations with his clients which proved useful down the road. In mid-1950s, George's sons, Anthony and Gabriel expanded the family business with the importation of Miele, Durkopp and GÃ¶ricke motorcycles and in 1959, the firm began importing Suzuki motorcycles. The company's profile grew from there and the firm was incorporated in 1964. Towards the end of the 1960s, the firm established a factory in Oregun, Lagos to assembly Suzuki motorcycles made from semi and completely knocked down parts. It was the first company in Nigeria to assemble motorcycles and the plant had a capacity to assemble 7,200 motorcycles at a shift. In 1978 when the government of Nigerian placed a ban on importation of completely built motorcycles, Boulos' profile was enhanced and it became the leading motorcycle seller in the country. &&&&& &&&&& In 1975, the firm acquired land at Ogba industrial estate beginning a process of complete manufacture of Suzuki motorcycles. The company also developed a distribution strategy that led to the creation of service centers across the country, stocking spare parts and inclusion of a Suzuki trained mechanic at each center. &&&&& &&&&& In 1985, the Boulos family diversified their interest in Nigeria with the establishment of Bel Impex Limited, a leading tissue paper manufacturer in Nigeria. Between 2010 and 2016, Boulos Enterprises represented Piaggio India and partially assembled tricycles in the country. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

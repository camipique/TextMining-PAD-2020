Baltimore and Ohio Railroad EL-5 class &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Baltimore and Ohio 2-8-8-0 No. 7109 &&&&& &&&&& The '''Baltimore and Ohio Railroad EL-5 class''' locomotives were 2-8-8-0 consolidation-mallet steam locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1919-1920, and were large and heavily modified articulated locomotives built for heavy coal drags on the Baltimore & Ohio. There were 26 Locomotives all together numbers 7145-7170, these engines went through many modifications, such as larger tenders, conversion from compound to simple articulated, and many more modifications, these engines were in use through World War II and started to be replaced soon after the War by dieselisation. The locomotives began retirement in the 1950s with the last unit removed from service in 1955. Sadly, none of these impressive engines were saved from the scrapperÂ´s torch. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Bai Baoshan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bai Baoshan''' (; 1958 – 6 May 1998) was a Chinese serial killer who killed a total of 15 people. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Bai Baoshan committed his first crime in 1983, serving 13 years of a 14-year sentence in prison for robbery and assault. After being released a year early, he sought revenge on authorities and in March 1996, he attacked a police station in Beijing. Using semi-automatic firearm previously stolen from a police officer, Bai injured two civilians and four others badly. The police suspected him of robbing and murdering a cigarette dealer. In Hebei Province, he raided another police station, killing another police officer and taking his automatic rifle with him. In Ürümqi, together with two accomplices, he killed a total of ten more people, including more policemen, and stole 1.5 million renminbi. When there was a dispute over the spoils, he shot one of his accomplices. &&&&& &&&&& On 16 October 1997, Bai was arrested in Beijing. Since he had committed most of his actions in the Xinjiang region, he was transferred there and charged with, among other things, 14 charges of murder. After being convicted on all counts and sentenced to death, he was publicly executed on 6 May 1998 by shooting. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& === Literature === &&&&& * Murakami, Peter and Julia: ''Encyclopedia of serial killers: 450 case studies of a pathological killing type.'' 7th edition, Ullstein paperback, Munich 2001, .

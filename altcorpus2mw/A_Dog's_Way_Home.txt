A Dog's Way Home &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''A Dog's Way Home''''' is a 2019 family adventure film directed by Charles Martin Smith from a screenplay by W. Bruce Cameron and Cathryn Michon, based on the 2017 book of the same name by Cameron. The film stars Ashley Judd, Edward James Olmos, Alexandra Shipp, Wes Studi, Chris Bauer, Barry Watson, and Jonah Hauer-King, and follows a dog named Bella (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard) who travels more than 400 miles to find her owner. It was released in the United States on January 11, 2019, to mixed reviews from critics, and has grossed $80 million worldwide, making it a moderate box office success. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& &&&&& Lucas and his girlfriend Olivia, two residents of Denver, Colorado, find a puppy in a construction site along with many kittens and a mother cat. He names the dog Bella and takes her home to live with him and his mother. Lucas continues to feed the cats at the old house, which puts him in the crosshairs of Gunter Beckenbauer, the man who wants to demolish the house. He even calls the city about the cats who live there, which delays the demolition. To get revenge, Gunter arranges for Bella to be declared a pit bull, because Denver has outlawed pitbulls as a dangerous breed. &&&&& &&&&& When Bella is eventually captured, Lucas picks her up, pays a fine, and is allowed to take her home. However, he is warned that if Bella is picked up again, she will be put down. To avoid this, Lucas sends Bella to live with Olivia's aunt and uncle in Farmington, New Mexico, until he and his mother can find another home outside of Denver's urban limits. However, Bella misses Lucas so much that she leaves Farmington and begins a 400-mile journey home, which will take more than two years to complete. She encounters a pack of coyotes, befriends a cougar cub, and helps rescue a man buried in an avalanche during her journey. At each place she goes, she learns that each of her new friends has its own home, and how she must keep moving to get back to her family. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& * Jonah Hauer-King as Lucas &&&&& * Ashley Judd as Terri &&&&& * Edward James Olmos as Axel &&&&& * Alexandra Shipp as Olivia &&&&& * Shelby as Bella &&&&& * Bryce Dallas Howard as the voice of Bella &&&&& * John Cassini as Chuck &&&&& * Wes Studi as Captain Mica &&&&& * Brian Markinson as Günter Beckenbauer &&&&& * Barry Watson as Gavin &&&&& * Tammy Gillis as Officer Leon &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& On November 7, 2017, Ashley Judd, Edward James Olmos and several others were cast in the film.

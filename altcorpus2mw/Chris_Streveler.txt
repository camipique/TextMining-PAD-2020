Chris Streveler &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Christopher L. Streveler''' (born January 6, 1995) is an American professional Canadian football quarterback for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Streveler played his college football at Minnesota and South Dakota. &&&&& &&&&& College career &&&&& Streveler played two years with the South Dakota Coyotes at the University of South Dakota. Streveler threw for 6,081 yards and 54 touchdowns, earning the MVFC Offensive Player of the Year award in 2017. He was a runner-up for the Walter Payton award. He spent three years at Minnesota before going to South Dakota. &&&&& &&&&& Professional career &&&&& === Winnipeg Blue Bombers === &&&&& On May 4, 2018, Streveler signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League after going undrafted in the 2018 NFL Draft. Expected to compete with Blue Bombers' quarterbacks Matt Nichols, Darian Durant and Alex Ross in training camp, to-be backup quarterback Darian Durant retired before the start of training camp. The Blue Bombers signed quarterback Bryan Bennett to compete with Streveler and Ross for backup behind Nichols. On June 1, 2018, Streveler played in his first preseason game with the Blue Bombers, going 10 for 10 with 140 yards and an 80-yard touchdown pass. On June 6, Nichols suffered an injury in practice that would later sideline him for four to six weeks to open the 2018 season. Instead of signing a veteran quarterback to lead the team, the Blue Bombers elected to start Streveler to open the season. Streveler became the first quarterback to start a CFL game coming out of college since 1994, when future Hall of Famer Anthony Calvillo started for the Las Vegas Posse. Streveler won his first CFL match in Week 2 when the Bombers defeated the Alouettes 56â€“10. Streveler started the first three games of the season for the Bombers before starting quarterback Matt Nichols returned from injury. Streveler continued to be utilized as a rusher and rotational passer, and finished the season by completing 86 out of 140 passes for 1,134 yards and 11 touchdowns against 5 interceptions. On the ground, Streveler had 77 carries for 441 yards and 10 more scores. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

La mesure de l'air'' (1992) by Joël-François Durand,) as well as their interpreter (''Aleph'' (1985) by Philippe Manoury, ''Dikha'' by Christophe Bertrand, ''By the way'' by Pascal Dusapin, ''Assonance III'' (1989) by Michael Jarrell...). &&&&& &&&&& In 1981, he created in Strasbourg with Françoise Kubler the "Accroche Note" ensemble offering programmes combining music from yesterday and today; this ensemble is supported in particular by the Ministry of Culture and the City of Strasbourg. &&&&& &&&&& He is soloist in various formations ranging from the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France, the Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg to ensembles of contemporary music in Europe (Nieuw Ensemble d'Amsterdam....) &&&&& &&&&& He regularly takes part in the Musica Festival of Strasbourg and to numerous others ( at Le Mans in 1989...). &&&&& &&&&& Angster teaches clarinet and chamber music at the Conservatoire de Strasbourg and at the Haute École des arts du Rhin in Strasbourg.

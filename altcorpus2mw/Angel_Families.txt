Angel Families &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Angel Families''' is a national organization of relatives of victims killed by illegal immigrants. President Donald Trump has invoked the group from time to time. &&&&& &&&&& The mother of a deceased child in an Angel Family is known as an "Angel Mom." &&&&& &&&&& Trump began to spotlight the issue during his 2016 Presidential campaign, a tactic that the Wall Street Journal and Slate compared with candidate Hillary Clinton's campaigning alongside Mothers of the Movement, a group founded in the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin to raise awareness about racial profiling. &&&&& &&&&& On Friday 22 June, 2018, Trump hosted an event at the White House for Angel Families during which 14 relatives held 11 photos of deceased relatives who had been killed by immigrants who were in the country illegally. Among those attending the event were Laura Wilkerson, mother of Josh; Juan Piña, father of Christy Sue Piña; Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant; and Michelle Root, mother of Sarah. &&&&& &&&&& Members of the families of more than three dozen different individuals killed by illegal immigrants have appeared at events with Trump over the years. &&&&& &&&&& Examples &&&&& &&&&& * 1990 - Christy Sue Piña, 14, allegedly raped and killed by Arsenio "Archie" Pacheco Leyva &&&&& * Jamiel Shaw, March 2, 2008. &&&&& * 16 November, 2010 - Josh Wilkerson, 18, killed by Hermilo Moralez &&&&& * 12 July 2012 - Cominic Durden, killed in crash by Juan Zacarias Lopez Tzun who was driving without a license.

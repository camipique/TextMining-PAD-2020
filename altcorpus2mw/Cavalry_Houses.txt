In 1748, Empress Elizabeth ordered the construction of 4 stone and 1 wooden houses for the steward and for the "cavaliers" who came to Sarskoe Selo, demolished by the "clerks of the choir". By an order of September 29, 1748, it was entrusted to the architect SI Chevakinsky. Single-storey houses with mezzanines in the baroque style were built in 1752-1753. In 1784, they were expanded by the architect IV Neyolov, who built up the mezzanines to a full-fledged second floor while maintaining a common style. Later, the houses were rebuilt in different ways. The houses of the 10th and 12th were preserved to the greatest extent in the 18th century. &&&&& &&&&& Architecture &&&&& The houses are close to the typical for the urban development of Petersburg 40-50-ies of the XVIII century. The rustled shoulder blades highlight the corners and the central parts of the facade. Pliers of baroque and at the same time of strict forms with decorative locking windows frame the windows of both floors. The floors are separated by wide profiled traction. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

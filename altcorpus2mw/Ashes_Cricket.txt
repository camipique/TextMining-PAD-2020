Ashes Cricket &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ashes Cricket''' is a 2017 video game created by Big Ant Studios, and released worldwide on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. It was the first Big Ant cricket game to be officially licensed to modern teams and players after the Don Bradman Cricket titles, and had the full licence for the 2017-18 Ashes series, which took place in Australia. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& Ashes Cricket was scored positively based on the authenticity and accuracy of the way it represents cricket, with IGN scoring the game 8/10 and noting "There has never been a cricket game this approachable, fully-featured, or fun, and the inclusion of licensed Ashes squads and stadia is just the icing on what is already an exceedingly customisable cricket cake". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

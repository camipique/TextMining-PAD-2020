However, the Bayfield 32 equipped with a tall rig is supposed to be quite fast, although it will not point as high as a club racer with a fin keel. This boat has a shallow draft, a wide beam, and plenty of living space down below. The Bayfield 32 is a good looking boat with a distinctive appearance which sets it apart from the many look-alike boats that were manufactured in Canada in large numbers in the 1970s and 1980s." &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of sailing boat types &&&&& &&&&& '''Related development''' &&&&& *Bayfield 25 &&&&& &&&&& '''Similar sailboats''' &&&&& *B-Boats B-32 &&&&& *Beneteau Oceanis 321 &&&&& *C&C 32 &&&&& *C&C 99 &&&&& *Catalina 320 &&&&& *Hunter 32 Vision &&&&& *Hunter 326 &&&&& *J/32 &&&&& *Mirage 32 &&&&& *Ontario 32 &&&&& *Nonsuch 324 &&&&& *Ranger 32 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

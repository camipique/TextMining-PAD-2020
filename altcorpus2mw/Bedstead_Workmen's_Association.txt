Bedstead Workmen's Association &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bedstead Workmen's Association''' was a trade union representing workers making bedframes in the United Kingdom, particularly in the area of Birmingham. &&&&& &&&&& The union was founded following a strike of bedframe workers in Birmingham in 1889. 4,000 workers went on strike, and they succeeded in winning a substantial pay increase. Fearing further industrial action, E. J. Smith of the employers' association agreed with the union to support a closed shop and representation on a joint wages board, in exchange for union members agreeing to only work for members of the employers' association. &&&&& &&&&& This Bedstead Alliance was initially successful, membership of the union growing to 2,500 by 1899. It then began a gradual decline, falling to only 200 in the 1950s. During the 1910s and 1920s, the union was part of the Metal Trades Federation. In 1961, the union was dissolved. &&&&& &&&&& General Secretaries &&&&& :1889: Walter Mills &&&&& :c.1910: William Palmer &&&&& :1950: R. Eastwood &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

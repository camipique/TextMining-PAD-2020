The recording was produced by Andy Paley. The music and lyrics were written by Jerry Lee Lewis, James Burton, Andy Paley, and Kenny Lovelace.

The Victoria hardtop had a "dual-bullet" grille and heavy chrome bumpers. A new "turn-key" ignition and front suspension featuring independent coil springs were also added. The head room was 36.1 inches. It was a new, post-war streamlined car model which could be customized into a hot rod. The Ford Crown Victoria model was produced in 1955. The opening and closing verse emphasizes the continuing popularity of the 1951 model: "Born in Detroit City back in '51 / She still looks pretty and she's loads of fun / Through thick and thin she's been my only one / It's my Crown Victoria Custom '51". &&&&& &&&&& Jerry Lee Lewis performs a piano solo followed by an electric guitar solo by James Burton. &&&&& &&&&& The recording is featured in the 1999 film ''A Texas Funeral'' starring Martin Sheen and Robert Patrick. &&&&& &&&&& The song was favorably reviewed in ''Rolling Stone'': "Whether reclaiming Hank Williams' wry 'I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive' or bragging about his hot rod — or is it his woman? — on 'Crown Victoria Custom '51,' Lewis is in high gear. He revels in the signatures of his fine madness, tossing random glissandi from his piano and shouting lyrics in a voice scuffed yet steel tipped." &&&&& &&&&& Album appearances &&&&& "Crown Victoria Custom '51" appeared on the following albums: &&&&& &&&&& * ''Young Blood'', Jerry Lee Lewis, Sire Records, 1995 &&&&& * ''Grooves'', Volume Ten, Various Artists, Time-Life Music/BMG, 1996 &&&&& * ''Legends of American Music.

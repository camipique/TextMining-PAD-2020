Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie''' ('''BDI'''), Federation of German Industries e. V. is the leading organization of German industry and industry-related service providers. It represents 40 industry associations and more than 100,000 companies with around 8 million employees. Membership is voluntary. A total of 15 state representations represent the interests of the economy at the regional level. Headquarters of the BDI is in the ''Haus der Deutschen Wirtschaft'' (house of the German economy) in Berlin; Between 1950 and 1999 this was in the House of German Industry in Cologne. In addition, the BDI has other offices abroad and is therefore represented internationally. President of the BDI is since January 1, 2017 Dieter Kempf. &&&&& &&&&& As an umbrella organization, the umbrella association is responsible for the perception and promotion of all concerns of the industries combined under the umbrella of the BDI. However, this does not entitle him to represent social issues. This function is reserved for the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA). The BDI statute limits the circle of members to leading industrial associations and working groups (§ 4, para. 2). As a result, sole proprietors or corporate networks can not obtain membership. From a political science point of view, the BDI has been described as an interest group in the association sectors "Economy and Labor" as well as "an investor top association of industrial sector and trade associations". As an advocacy group of the industry, the leading association operates interest articulation, following the process of forming an opinion within the association. The BDI lobbies globally in the sense of industrially active enterprises and is in "all economic relevant legislative processes heard." &&&&& &&&&& Presidents &&&&& * 1949–1971: Fritz Berg &&&&& * 1972–1976: Hans Günter Sohl &&&&& * 1977 (January–October): Hanns Martin Schleyer &&&&& * 1978 (January–September): Nikolaus Fasolt &&&&& * 1978–1984: Rolf Rodenstock &&&&& * 1985–1986: Hans Joachim Langmann &&&&& * 1987–1990: Tyll Necker &&&&& * 1991–1992: Heinrich Weiss &&&&& * 1992–1994: Tyll Necker &&&&& * 1995–2000: Hans-Olaf Henkel &&&&& * 2001–2004: Michael Rogowski &&&&& * 2005–2008: Jürgen Thumann &&&&& * 2009–2012: Hans-Peter Keitel &&&&& * 2013–2016: Ulrich Grillo &&&&& * since 2017: Dieter Kempf &&&&& &&&&& Member associations &&&&& *The association looks after the following 40 member associations: &&&&& *Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) &&&&& *Main Association of the German Construction Industry e.V. &&&&& *Federal Association of Building Materials - Stones and Eros (BBS) &&&&& *Association of Consulting Engineers e.V.

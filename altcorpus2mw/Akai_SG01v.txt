Akai SG01v &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Akai SG01v''' is a ROMpler (meaning it plays prerecorded samples - it doesn't generate any sounds of its own.) It was produced by Akai in 1995. It is half 19" racksize wide and it can be controlled by any MIDI compatible controller. It is 32 voice polyphony and 16 part multi-timbral. It reproduces some surprisingly excellent sounds (samples) of old analogue synthesizers including 2 drum kits. The V in SG01V is for "Vintage". In the same series there is also a SG01K version (K for "keys") &&&&& &&&&& Front panel &&&&& The front panel contains a three digit, 7-segment LED display, a volume control button. Basic editing can be done via the seven control buttons on the front of the unit. &&&&& &&&&& Back panel &&&&& * MIDI interface &&&&& * Main out &&&&& * Headphones &&&&& * Power supply &&&&& &&&&& Hardware &&&&& The CPU used inside the unit to control it was D-70236, and the DAC Digital to audio converter was UPD63210GT &&&&& &&&&& Sounds &&&&& The unit contains 256 preset patches and two drum kits. &&&&& Patches use vendors such as Roland, Moog, Oberheim, PPG, Solina as inspiration for the sounds and drums are electronic based and are similar to Roland TR-808 and Roland TR-909 sounds and also Simmons drum kits. &&&&& &&&&& PSU &&&&& The unit requires a (supplied) 10V DC power supply unit. &&&&& &&&&& Dimensions &&&&& Dimensions: Width 214mm, Height 257.6mm, Depth 43.7mm. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

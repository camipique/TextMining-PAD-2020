Bugoloobi Wastewater Treatment Plant &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bugoloobi Wastewater Treatment Plant''' ('''BWTP'''), also '''Bugoloobi Sewerage Treatment Plant''' ('''BSTP'''), is a wastewater treatment project in Uganda. When completed as expected in 2018, the treatment plant will be the largest wastewater treatment plant in the countries of the East African Community, and capable of processing of wastewater daily. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& The water treatment facility is under construction in the neighborhood of Bugoloobi, in Nakawa Division, in the south-eastern section of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. This is approximately , by road, east of the central business district of he city. The geographical coordinates of the plant are 0°19'06.0"N, 32°36'27.0"E (Latitude:0.318333; Longitude:32.607500). &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& The Bugoloobi WTP, collects wastewater and sewerage from parts of the city, including Old Kampala, Mengo, Katwe, Nsambya, Kibuli, Mbuya, Nakawa, Naguru, Bukoto and Kamwookya. The new expanded STP is aimed at increasing and improving sanitation services in the city and reducing the pollution of the ''Nakivubo Channel'', a surface-water effluent into Lake Victoria, thereby increasing the lake's environmental sustainability. &&&&& &&&&& The project involves the construction of an ultra-modern sewerage treatment plant in Bugoloobi, a sewerage pre-treatment plant in Kinawattaka, a sewerage pumping station on Kibira Road and a sewer network measuring . New areas to be added to the sewerage network include Bugoloobi, Kyambogo, Kasokoso, Kinnawattaka, Banda, Butabika and neighbouring areas. &&&&& &&&&& The bio-digesters in this plant, are expected to generate gases, which will be heated to generate of electricity, to be used internally in the plant. In addition, the solid wastes removed from the wastewater, are expected to be dried and sold as fertilizer, or as raw material for the manufacture of cooking briquettes. &&&&& &&&&& Ownership &&&&& The water treatment facility is wholly owned by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), a government parastatal company, responsible for provision of potable water and sewerage services nationwide. &&&&& &&&&& Construction &&&&& Construction began in May 2014, and is expected to conclude in 2018. NWSC plans to construct new sewerage treatment plants in Nalukolongo, between Ndeeba and Nateete, along the Kampala–Masaka Road and in Kajjansi, in addition the one in Lubigi, completed in 2014. &&&&& &&&&& Financing &&&&& This project has received funding from (a) the government of Uganda, (b) the African Development Bank (c) the European Union and (d) KfW. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Ministry of Water and Environment (Uganda) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Website of National Water & Sewerage Corporation &&&&& * Website of Ministry of Water and Environment (Uganda) &&&&& * NWSC to increase water supply by 50% As of 5 August 2015. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

In the mid-18th century, gemstone prospector David Frenzel (1691-1772) found numerous examples of this wood in the hills in and around Chemnitz. One of his 1751 finds is one of the few petrified wood specimens still possessing its roots. Later a collector, the Hilbersdorf contractor GÃ¼ldner, bequeathed some of the petrified logs to King Albert Museum in Chemnitz. The first director of the Museum, Johann Traugott Sterzel, took over the investigation of the findings. The Sterzeleanum in the museum (the petrified forest display) is dedicated to him. &&&&& &&&&& PTwo ''Arthropitys .sp'' fossils discovered in Italy &&&&& ''A. bistriata'' fossils from Chemnitz &&&&& petrified forest of Chemnitz in which ''Arthrophitys .sp'' is common.

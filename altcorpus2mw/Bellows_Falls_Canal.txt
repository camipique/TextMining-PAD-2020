The canal was completed in 1802. &&&&& &&&&& View of Bellows Falls Canal from Bridge Street &&&&& Usage declined with the arrival of railroad service in the area in 1849 and the canal ceased to operate boat traffic operations in 1858. From this time, the canal was used to supply water power to the neighbouring mills and, after 1868, was acquired by the power company. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

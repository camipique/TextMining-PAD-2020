Antony Wassermann &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Berkeley in 1989 &&&&& '''Antony John Wassermann''' (born 13 February 1957) is a British mathematician, working in operator algebras. He is known for his works on conformal field theory (providing several series of subfactors), on the actions of compact groups on von Neumann algebras, and his proof of the Baum–Connes conjecture for connected reductive linear Lie groups. &&&&& &&&&& He attended Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne from 1968 to 1974, and received his Ph.D at the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, under the supervision of Jonathan Rosenberg (''Automorphic actions of compact groups on operator algebras''). &&&&& &&&&& He was ''Directeur de Recherches'' CNRS at Aix-Marseille University (France) from 1999 to 2013. &&&&& &&&&& He is the son of the quantum physicist Gerhard Dietrich Wassermann and the brother of the mathematician Alexander Simon Wassermann. &&&&& &&&&& Honours &&&&& * Bronze medal, International Mathematical Olympiad, 1974. &&&&& * Miller Research Fellowship recipient in 1986–88. &&&&& * Winner of the Whitehead Prize in 1990. &&&&& * Invited speaker, International Congresses of Mathematicians, 1994, Zürich. &&&&& &&&&& Selected bibliography &&&&& * ''Operator algebras and conformal field theory.

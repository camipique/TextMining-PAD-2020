Acura A-Spec and Type-S models &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''A-Spec''' and '''Type-S''' marques represents the high-performance divisions of cars produced by Acura. Acura utilized the Type R marque for their high-performance division of cars from 1992 to 2001, when they produced the Acura NSX and Acura Integra. The first vehicle offered as a Type-S variant was the 2002-2003 Acura TL, and the first vehicle offered as an A-Spec variant was the 2004-2006 Acura TL. &&&&& &&&&& Type-S &&&&& The Acura TL Type-S model was introduced in 2002. It featured a 3.2 L SOHC VTEC J-series V6 and added 35 hp (26 kW) over the base model for a total 260 hp (194 kW). Further upgrades included wheels, firmer seats and suspension. &&&&& &&&&& In 2002, the Acura CL Type-S was offered, as a 2003 model, with a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission with a helical limited-slip differential. It used the same powertrain from the 2002-2003 TL Type S. The 6-speed CL deleted some minor interior features from the automatic, such as a center console light. Also, the heated seats only featured one heat setting (vs. high and low in the auto). VSA and TCS were also not found on the 6-speed car, and as such, a 3-channel ABS unit was used. &&&&& &&&&& The RSX Type-S had a 200 hp (150 kW) (2002–2004) K20A2 or 210 hp (160 kW) K20Z1 (labeled in 2006 as 201 hp due to SAE hp calculation revision) in 2005-2006 and a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. An automatic transmission was not offered on the Type-S. The Type-S included additional features such as sport-tuned suspension, gunmetal painted wheels, 11.8" ventilated front disc brakes, larger sway bars and a Bose 7-speaker (including a subwoofer mounted on the spare tire) audio system. &&&&& &&&&& The TL Type-S was introduced once again for the 2007 through 2008 model years. The new TL Type-S received the Acura RL's 3.5-liter V6 tuned to with either a 5-speed automatic with F1 style paddle shifters or a 6-speed manual transmission. The manual transmission includes a limited slip differential. Exterior differences include quad exhaust pipes, restyled rear lamps and front fascia, lip spoiler, wider side sills, Brembo brakes, dark silver 10-spoke wheels, a "black chrome" grille rather than the standard glossy grille, and exclusive Type-S badging, plus an exclusive new color option, Kinetic Blue Pearl. The interior has Type-S badging on the steering wheel and headrests, more highly bolstered front seats, two-tone seats (only with the Ebony/Silver interior), metal racing pedals, carbon fiber trim, and red interior lighting (as opposed to blue in the base TL). Touch screen navigation is standard and the suspension has been firmed up. The only options are the aforementioned transmission and high performance summer tires (Bridgestone Potenzas) rather than the standard all-season tires (Michelin Pilot MXM4s). &&&&& &&&&& The Canadian-exclusive CSX Type-S debuted as a 2007 model and was the last remaining Type-S model when it was discontinued in 2011. It featured a 2.0L i-VTEC engine, an increase of 42 hp (31 kW) over the base CSX engine. The "sport-tuned" suspension added stiffer springs, firmer damping and thicker stabilizer bars compared to the regular CSX and is supported on 215/45R17 all-season tires and 17-inch alloy wheels.  Other additional features included Vehicle Stability Assist, 350-watt 7-speaker audio system, navigation system with voice-command, digital audio card reader with USB and bluetooth connectivity, Type-S badging, rear-deck spoiler, and red-illuminated instrument panel and foot-wells. &&&&& &&&&& At the 2018 Detroit Auto Show, Acura announced it will revive the Type-S performance models by 2020. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& A-Spec &&&&& A-Spec badge on an Acura TLX &&&&& In 2004, Acura offered to the public a factory-sanctioned "tuner package" version of the TL called the TL A-SPEC. This version features a suspension tuned by Makoto Tamamura, an indication of the TL A-SPEC's aggressive engineering. In addition, an underbody kit, spoiler, limited edition A-SPEC steering wheel, "A-SPEC" badge on the back, and 18-inch (460 mm) wheels are standard issue on the A-SPEC package. When installed at purchase, the car's 4 year/50,000 miles (80,000 km) warranty applies to the package as well. This package was offered for the TL until 2006. &&&&& &&&&& For the 2005–2008 models, Acura offered an A-Spec package for the RL. The dealer-installed package consisted of a body kit, badging, revised suspension and different wheels. The package was first announced at a late 2004 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. It should be noted that the A-Spec package for sale was distinctly different from the Acura RL A-Spec Concept Vehicle announced and shown as a striking dark red one-of-a-kind custom creation in early 2005 at the Detroit Auto Show. &&&&& &&&&& Acura offers an A-Spec variant on most of their vehicles, which includes sportier styling on both the exterior and interior, and a firmer suspension. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Acura USA &&&&& * Acura Canada &&&&& * Code Error Acura &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

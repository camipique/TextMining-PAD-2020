Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. RD Legal Funding, LLC &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. RD Legal Funding, LLC''''', 332 F. Supp. 3d 729 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), was a lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Attorney General of New York against Defendants RD Legal Funding, LLC, RD Legal Finance, LLC, RD Legal Funding Partners, LP and Roni Dersovitz, the founder and owner of the RD Entities. &&&&& On June 21, 2018, Senior U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska held that Title X of the Doddâ€“Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which established the CFPB as an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System, is unconstitutional. This holding is in contrast with the ''en banc'' holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in ''PHH Corp. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau'', and partially adopts the separate dissents of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Judge Karen L. Henderson in that case. &&&&& &&&&& The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on September 14, 2018. &&&&&  &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

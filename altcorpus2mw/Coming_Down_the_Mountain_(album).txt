Coming Down the Mountain (album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Coming Down the Mountain''''' is an album by pianist, saxophonist and composer Joe Maneri which was recorded in 1993 and released on the HatOLOGY label in 1997. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& In JazzTimes, John Murph wrote "Microtonal master, Joe Maneri upholds free jazz’s basic principles in the highest regards by foregoing annotated compositions, which forces his musicians to rely on intuitive improvisation and group empathy. As ''Coming Down The Mountain'' attests, the results can be surprisingly tranquil, especially when the musicians opt for silence and elongated contours instead of the usual bag of overpowering dissonance ... ''Coming Down The Mountain'' is yet another fine recording by Maneri". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All compositions by Joe Maneri &&&&& # "Swing High" – 6:20 &&&&& # "Swing Higher" – 11:04 &&&&& # "Coming Down the Mountain" – 11:23 &&&&& # "Joe's Alto" – 1:49 &&&&& # "Say It All" – 15:07 &&&&& # "To End or Not to End?" – 8:29 &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Joe Maneri – piano, reeds &&&&& *Mat Maneri – violin &&&&& *Ed Schuller – bass &&&&& *Randy Peterson – drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

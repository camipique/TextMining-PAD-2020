He came up with the idea of a cowboy western set in colonial Java first in 2014, three years before production on the film, with actor Ario Bayu being among the first to be informed of his plans. The total number of actors and crew involved with the film numbered 220 to 230 people. &&&&& &&&&& ===Pre-production=== &&&&& On 3 July 2017, actor Tio Pakusadewo first revealed details of the film to ''Kompas'' and announced that he was set to appear in it alongside the likes of Ario Bayu, Pevita Pearce, Happy Salma, Donny Damara and El Manik. Principal photography was scheduled for 20 August 2017. &&&&& &&&&& The initial script for the film was roughly 150 pages before being condensed to 100 pages. The rehearsals and pre-production took about three months. &&&&& &&&&& Pevita Pearce stated she underwent archery training for two months. During rehearsals she trained with stuntmen from France and Thailand, and stated that riding the buffalo was a "very big challenge" for her, describing them as "wild" and harder to control than horses. &&&&& &&&&& Yoshi Sudarso stated that he was the last to join the cast, and had difficulty learning Indonesian, having moved to the United States at age nine where he lived for 20 years and so wasn't as fluent in the language. He spent a month learning Indonesian, but stated that costars Pevita Pearce, Hannah Al Rashid and others were helpful. Sudarso also revealed he was offered a lucrative eight-year Hollywood contract as a stuntman and had to choose between doing the film or accepting the contract. After reading the script and speaking to the director, he made the decision to work on ''Buffalo Boys'' because his "heart and mind was in acting, not stunts anymore." Speaking to NBC News later in the month, Sudarso stated "Westerns are such a big part of American culture, but as Asian Americans, we never see ourselves in them." &&&&& &&&&& ===Filming=== &&&&& The film was shot on location in Yogyakarta, Java and in a studio in Batam, Riau Islands. In Yogyakarta, the production rented land in the Watu Murah area of Nanggulan, Kulon Progo. Scenes were typically shot between 3 AM and 6 PM. Filming took place across 40 days. &&&&& &&&&& According to Wiluan, they had initially thought riding a buffalo would be easy similar to riding a horse. However, they found it to be one of the most difficult tasks. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& A teaser trailer for the film was released on 16 March 2018. The full-length trailer was released on 20 April. On 2 May, the line up for the 28th Fantasia International Film Festival was released which included a world premiere for the film slated for 14 July 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * List of submissions to the 91st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film &&&&& * List of Singaporean submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

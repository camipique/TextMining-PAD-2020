The type collection was made in Maoershan Nature Reserve (Xing'an County, Guangxi), where it was found growing on a fallen angiosperm branch. The specific epithet ''lactea'' refers to the cream-coloured fruit body. The fungus has a trimitic hyphal system, and its generative hyphae have clamp connections. Its smooth, thin-walled spores range in shape from oblong to ellipsoidal, and typically measure 3.1–3.6 by 2.1–2.4 μm. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

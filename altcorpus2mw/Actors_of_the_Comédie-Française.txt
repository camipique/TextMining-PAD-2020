Actors of the Comédie-Française &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez vous''''' (), usually referred to in Russian sources as '''''Actors of the Comédie-Française''''', is an oil on panel painting in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, by French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, an important artist of the Rococo style. A part of the Crozat collection, the work was acquired by Catherine II of Russia in 1772 and then held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Winter Palace and later in the Gatchina Palace; in 1920, the painting was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles before studies of Watteau's drawings in the 20th century established a possible identity. &&&&& &&&&& The painting is a rare example of a group portrait which depicts five figures, with four of them presumed to be and identified as members of the Comédie-Française in their roles from Florent Carton Dancourt's play ''The Three Cousins'': Charlotte Desmares, a mistress of the Duke of Orléans; Philippe Poisson, Pierre Le Noir, a son of La Thorillière and brother-in-law of Dancourt; and Adrienne Lecouvreur, a mistress of Maurice de Saxe; the sole other figure is an unknown black boy (presumed to be Pierre Crozat's servant, also appearing in ''The Conversation'' and ''The Music Party''). &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ===Composition=== &&&&& &&&&& In the painting, Watteau depicts five figures standing at what appears to be a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a hat, dressed in a light blue camisole and brown striped cape. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand. &&&&& &&&&& The panel the work was painted on is upholstered in wood, thus making the exact measuring difficult. Defects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder. &&&&& &&&&& ===Subjects identification=== &&&&& engraving of ''Actors of the Comédie-Français'', on which its name of ''The Coquettes'' was based on. &&&&& Until the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject. François-Bernard Lépicié's 1741 obituary of believed the figures to be returning from a ball and therefore called it ''Retour de Bal''; in contrary, ''Catalogue Crozat'' (1755) and Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville described it as a depiction of masked figures preparing for a ball. For some time, the work's title established as ''The Coquettes'' (), based on verses included by Thomassin's engraving. Early in the 1900s, the French author Virgile Josz presumed the work to be a depiction of commedia dell'arte masks, with the old man as Pantalone, women as Rosaura and Isabella, and the young man as Scapino; until the middle of the 20th centrury, this points was shared by Russian authors and sources, including works by Alexandre Benois and , as well as the Hermitage Museum's 1958 catalogue of the painting collection. Josz's contemporary Louis de Fourcaud considered figures to be "a family group dressed for an elegant masquerade," painted after material from sketchbooks. &&&&& &&&&& Russian sources similarly had various definitions on the subject; refers to the work as ''Personnages en masques'' () in the two-volume catalogue of the Hermitage collection; the Hermitage's 1797 catalogue features the title ''The Mascarade'', while the 1859 inventory registry features only the work's description—"two women, talking with two men, and a negro beside them". &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Authorship and dating=== &&&&& Watteau's authorship of the panel has never been seriously questioned by scholars except , who considered it a work of Philippe Mercier in a 1912 letter to his German colleague Ernst Heinrich Zimmermann; the latter chose to classify it among the "doubtful pictures;" similarly, Jean Ferré included the work among "attributed to Watteau." Later studies have ruled possible doubts out, given the work's high artistic qualities as well as preparatory drawings and Thomassin's engraving; in her 1964 monograph, Nemilvova presumed Wrangel have been led to his conclusion because of the work's presence in the Gatchina Palace; in an entry for ''A Watteau Abecedario'', Martin Eidelberg adds that Mercier could not paint with the same characteristics and artistic level Watteau had. &&&&& &&&&& Scholars were also divided over the dating of ''Actors…''. Jacque Mathey, as well as Nemilova, favored a relatively early date of 1711-1713. Others authors including Adhemar, Charles Sterling, Ettore Camesasca and Donald Posner opted for a 1716–1717 dating, inclining toward the work's artistic maturity; Rosenberg proposed a 1714-1715 dating. &&&&& <!-- &&&&& Provenance &&&&& In an article published in the March 1928 issue of ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'', Ernst reported that in years after Watteau's death, ''Actors...'' were known in the collection of royal collection conservator Nicolas Bailly, from which it passed into Pierre Crozat's collection before 1755. In 1772, it was acquired by Catherine II of Russia, and was placed in the Winter Palace. At some point after the 1850s, it was relocated into the Gatchina Palace. In 1920, it was transitioned into the Winter Palace again, becoming an exhibit of the Hermitage's expositions. &&&&& --> &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * ''Actors of the Comédie-Française'' at the Hermitage's official website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

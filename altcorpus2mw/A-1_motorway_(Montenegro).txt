987	A-1_motorway_(Montenegro)
A-1 motorway (Montenegro) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Bar-Boljare motorway''' (Montenegrin: Аутопут Бар - Бољаре, ''Autoput Bar - Boljare''), is a future motorway in Montenegro. It is part of larger inter-countries project Belgrade–Bar motorway. The motorway will connect Serbian capital of Belgrade with Montenegrin Capital of Podgorica and Bar, Montenegro's main seaport. Italy, Montenegro and Serbia are lobbying to list the route with Pan-European corridors, and it is frequently referred to as part of proposed '''Corridor XI''', or '''4B''' - an envisioned ferry/motorway corridor linking Bari, Bar, Belgrade and Bucharest. &&&&& &&&&& The road's construction began on May 11, 2015. &&&&& &&&&& Route description &&&&& &&&&& Motorway is to be built in three phases: &&&&& &&&&& * (Bar) Đurmani - Sozina tunnel - Virpazar - Bistrica - Šteke - Ćafa - Tološko polje - (Podgorica) Smokovac - this is the southernmost section of the motorway, that will link the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica with the main Montenegrin seaport in Bar. Potential investors, such as EBRD and EIB, were suggesting that this section should be built first, as it will likely have the biggest traffic volume following completion. The planned length of this section is 51 km. &&&&& * (Podgorica) Smokovac - Bioče - Pelev Brijeg - Lijeva Rijeka - Veruša - Mateševo - this middle section of the motorway is considered a priority, because of its significance as a link between Podgorica and northern Montenegro. The current road link (E65 and E80), carved into the Morača canyon, is a curvy mountainous road, considered dangerous during the winter, and is a bottleneck in Montenegrin road network. Thus, building this section first is a requirement in bidding documents presented by the Montenegrin Government. This section will have a length of 41 km, and is by far the most expensive section of the motorway, with a cost per kilometer of motorway estimated to be higher than 20 million EUR. As of 2015, this section is under construction. &&&&& * Mateševo - Andrijevica - Berane - Crnča - Boljare - Border with Serbia - this northernmost section of the motorway is likely to be completed only after progress is made on the Serbian section of the motorway south of Požega. The planned length of this section is 73 km. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& In October 2008 Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism made a proposal for Detailed Zoning Plan of Bar - Boljare Motorway. Before this, a small part of first section was already built. On July 13, 2005, Montenegro's national day, Sozina tunnel was opened. Together with associated road north of the tunnel, it will eventually become a part of the motorway, after second parallel road and tunnel is built. &&&&& &&&&& Middle section of the motorway was made a priority by the Government of Montenegro, and it was decided that this section will be built first. Tender was invited for building of this section. The bidding offers were reviewed in March 2009, and the top bid came from the Croatian consortium, led by the company of ''Konstruktor''. This was followed by signing of contract document, and announcing of the beginning of construction works in June 2009. The official construction works opening ceremony happened on October 15, 2009, in the village of Gornje Mrke north of Podgorica, attended by the then Prime Ministers of Montenegro (Milo Đukanović), Serbia (Mirko Cvetković) and Croatia (Jadranka Kosor). However, the Croatian consortium failed to provide necessary bank guarantees in a timely manner, so the contract was cancelled eight months later. &&&&& &&&&& The second best rated bidder, a consortium of the Greek company Aktor and the Israeli company Shikun & Binui was called in for negotiations by the Government. After negotiations, it was agreed that Aktor/HCH consortium builds two southern sections of the motorway for a price of 1.575 billion euro. The third and the northernmost section, from Mateševo to Boljare (border with Serbia), as well as the small strip across the Lake Skadar, were to be the subject of further negotiations. However, the Greek-Israeli consortium also failed to provide bank guarantees, so the negotiations between the consortium and the Government of Montenegro were ended in December 2010. &&&&& &&&&& The Government of Montenegro began to explore financing options for motorway construction, including negotiations with Chinese investors. The possibility of China Road and Bridge Group and China Poly Group Corporation building the road, with the financial backing of Exim Bank of China was explored. In January 2011, the Montenegrin Minister of Transportation has sent an official letter of invitation to the ''Poly Group''. &&&&& &&&&& In April 2013 discussions were still under way between the Montenegrin government and Chinese parties and an offer of US$1bn of financing by EXIM bank and the selection of a preferred construction consortium was announced in July 2013. &&&&& &&&&& In December 2014 negotiations with Chinese partners have successfully concluded. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2015 works on first section in Montenegro, Smokovac-Uvač-Mateševo have started, expected to finish within 48 months. &&&&& &&&&& Current status &&&&& &&&&& As of June 2018, the only built part of the motorway is the Sozina tunnel and the associated road immediately north of it. Currently, this part stands as single carriageway with two lanes, with a second carriageway planned to be built. &&&&& &&&&& The section between Smokovac near Podgorica and Mateševo near Kolašin is under construction, and it will be Montenegro's first full motorway section. It is expected to be opened in May 2019. &&&&& &&&&& The pillars of the Moračica bridge, the tallest bridge on the motorway, were finished on October 2017. Right tube of Klopot Tunnel the is first tunnel that was excavated on motorway on 25 August 2017. In 2017, tunnels Jabučki Krš (1370 m and 1430 m) , Mrke (829 m and 800 m) and Vilac (815 m and 950 m) were also excavated. &&&&& &&&&& In 2018, tunnels Mrki Krš (700 m each tube), Mala Trava (1900 m and 1884 m), Suka (600 m each tube) and Vežešnik (2474 m and 2414 m) were excavated. Longest tunnel in middle section of motorway, Vjeternik Tunnel (3039 m and 2852 m) was excavated on 9 July 2018. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

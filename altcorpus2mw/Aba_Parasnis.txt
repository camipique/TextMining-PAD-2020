375	Aba_Parasnis
Aba Parasnis &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Vithal Sakharam Parasnis''' (17xx-18xx) was popularly known as 'Aba' hence he is usually referred to as '''Aba Parasnis''' by sources. He was a Sanskrit, Vedic and Persian scholar of the early 19th century Maharashtra. He was a native of the Satara district of Maharashtra. &&&&& &&&&& Consultant to James Grand Duff &&&&& Aba was one of the three scholars who were consultants to the British Historian James Grant Duff, specifically in Persian sources of the &&&&& history of Maharashtra - the other two scholars being Balajipant Natu and Balvantrao Chitnis. Duff would persistently demand more material and would consult and ask them for interpretations of terms and policies and explanations for events in the materials that he had in his possession. His questions were directed to the origin and justification of specific policies and concepts - taxes such as ''chauth'' and ''sardeshmukhi''. Duff would be frustrated by what he deemed as "inconsistent answers" from these knowledgeable people. The scholars such as Parasnis, on their part, resented the "insistent cross examination" by Duff. &&&&& &&&&& Debate on Vedic scriptures and Hindu Shastras &&&&& Parasnis is most notable for a unique "Brahmin varna vs Kshatriya varna" debate that took place at Satara. It involved discussions and disputes related to the intricacies of the Hindu Shastras, Vedas and Puranas. The Kshatriya varna was represented by Parasnis and the Brahman varna was &&&&& represented by Raghvacharya Gajendragadkar. This historic debate took place in the early 19th century Maharashtra. It was attended by hundreds of prominent Brahmins all over Maharashtra. Historians have credited Parasnis for debating effectively and "holding his own". &&&&& &&&&& Literature &&&&& Two Sanskrit books "Karmakalapdruma" and "Siddhantavijaya" were authored by Parasnis and published by Pratapsimha. &&&&& The "Siddhantavijaya" is considered important because it gives details of the Maratha clan system. It is written in Sanskrit with some content in &&&&& marathi. The other Sanskrit scripture authored by him is "Karmakalpadruma". It is a manual for Hindu rituals and hence called the samskara manual. A translation of Siddhanatavijaya and some commentary was written by Mahadev Ganesh Dongre in the early 20th century. &&&&& &&&&& Sanskrit School &&&&& Pratapsimha realized the importance of the knowledge of Sanskrit and decided to open a "pathshala" to teach Sanskrit to boys from the Maratha caste. Parasnis was the first head of this school. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

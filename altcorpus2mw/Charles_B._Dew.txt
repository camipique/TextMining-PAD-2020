Charles B. Dew &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Charles B. Dew''' (1937) is an American author and historian, specializing in the history of the Southern United States and the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era. He has published three books, one of which was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. He is the Ephraim Williams Professor of American History at Williams College. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Dew grew up in a white family in St. Petersburg, Florida, which he called "a Jim Crow town to the core". His family had an African-American help, who ate and drank from her own plate and cup, and who used a "grossly unequal" bathroom for her only. In an essay he wrote on the occasion of the publication of ''The Making of a Racist'', he commented that he hadn't crossed the Mason–Dixon line until he went to college in 1954, and that his experiences at Williams College, where he studied history (which "blew his assumptions about Confederate glory out of the water") and had black classmates, were formative for his developing a critique of what he termed "collective white blindness". &&&&& &&&&& Dew is a descendant of Thomas Roderick Dew (1802–1846), who was a "passionate apologist" for slavery, and he writes about his family heritage in his 2016 book ''The Making of a Racist.'' The book was the result of a self-examination which he said was prompted by his coming across a price list for slaves from 1860: "I thought, how could my white southern ancestors have been complicit in this?", to which the only answers are greed and the belief in white superioity, which Southern boys received "by osmosis". &&&&& &&&&& Dew is married to writer Robb Forman Dew. He graduated from Williams College in 1958 and received his Ph.D. in History from Johns Hopkins University in 1964. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& &&&&& # &&&&& ::*Critic Leonard Pitts was less than impressed with the answers that Dew provided for why he and his family remained racist for a long time, though he found his account of falling away from the racism of his family and region "compelling". &&&&& # Recipient of 2001 Fletcher Pratt Award, awarded by Civil War Roundtable &&&&& # Notable Book of the Year for 1994 by The New York Times Book Review; published as paperback in 1995. &&&&& # Revised edition published by Library of Virginia, 1998. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

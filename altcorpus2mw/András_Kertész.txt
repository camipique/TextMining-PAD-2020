Within the framework of his modular philosophy of linguistics he revealed the relationship between the cognitive and the social factors of linguistic theorizing. He extended the methods of both modular and holistic cognitive linguistics to the analysis of scientific concept formation. He developed the heuristics of the segmental phonology of German. Together with Csilla Rákosi he put forward the so-called ’p-model’ of plausible argumentation which, besides capturing the structure of linguistic theories, can also be applied to the solution of problems in the general philosophy of science and argumentation theory. &&&&& &&&&& Awards and honors &&&&& *2017 Széchenyi Prize (highest scientific award in Hungary) &&&&& *2014 Member of Academy of Europe (Academia Europaea), London &&&&& *2013 Pro Germanistica Hungarica Medal &&&&& *2010 Full Member (F.

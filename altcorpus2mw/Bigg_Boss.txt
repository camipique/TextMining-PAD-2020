2644	Bigg_Boss
Bigg Boss &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Bigg Boss''''' is an Indian reality television game show franchise produced by EndemolShine India through Viacom 18 and Colors, broadcast in India, subsequently syndicated internationally and made available online as VOD through OTT platforms. There have been 7 versions of the show in 7 individual languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent. The first show of the franchise was ''Bigg Boss'' in Hindi which debuted in 2006. The franchise has extended its presence in Kannada, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Malayalam as of 2018. Though only celebrities were selected to be the housemates in the initial seasons, general public have been auditioned to be on the show in the latest seasons of Hindi, Kannada and Telugu versions of the show. &&&&& &&&&& Synopsis &&&&& In the show, contestants called "housemates" live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. &&&&& &&&&& Premise &&&&& The program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Bigg Boss'', and the "Confession Room" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction. At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via SMS or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner. &&&&& &&&&& The contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as "Bigg Boss"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' "luxury budget" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& === Creation === &&&&& ''Bigg Boss'' is a Hindi (Bollywood) adaption of ''Big Brother'' created in Netherlands by John de Mol Jr., largely based on the ''Celebrity Big Brother'' model owned by the Endemol Shine Group. The show was named ''Bigg Boss'' and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at Lonavla in Maharashtra. ''Bigg Boss'' debuted on television in 2006 through Sony Entertainment Television with Arshad Warsi as the host. The show gained popularity after Shilpa Shetty emerged as the winner in Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK) and replaced Warsi as the host in the second season of ''Bigg Boss''. From the second season, the show has moved to Viacom 18's Colors. &&&&& &&&&& === Expansion === &&&&& The show's acceptance and success among the Indian audience paved way for its expansion into other Indian languages. After the sixth season was completed in Hindi in 2013, ''Kannada'' and ''Bengali'' adaptions were created by Endemol through ETV Network with the same house and resources with Sudeep and Mithun Chakraborty as hosts respectively. While the Kannada version became an instant hit, Bengali version did not turn out to be very successful. The Kannada version saw its subsequent seasons annually, similar to Hindi while Bengali version has completed only 2 seasons in 6 years. &&&&& &&&&& Upon completion of 12 seasons in Hindi, 6 seasons in Kannada and 2 seasons in Bengali, Endemol extended its presence in South India by creating Tamil and Telugu versions of the show with Star India in 2017 and roped in Kamal Haasan and Jr NTR as hosts respectively. In 2018, the show has been adapted to Marathi with Viacom 18 and Malayalam with Star India and the hosts are Mahesh Manjrekar and Mohanlal respectively. &&&&& &&&&& Summary &&&&& &&&&& : Currently

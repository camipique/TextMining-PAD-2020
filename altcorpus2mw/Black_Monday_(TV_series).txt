To this day, no one knows who caused it—until now. It's the story of how a group of outsiders took on the blue-blood, old-boys club of Wall Street and ended up crashing the world’s largest financial system, a Lamborghini limousine, Don Henley’s birthday party and the glass ceiling." &&&&& &&&&& Cast and characters &&&&& ===Main=== &&&&& * Don Cheadle as Maurice Monroe &&&&& * Andrew Rannells as Blair Pfaff &&&&& * Regina Hall as Dawn Darcy &&&&& * Paul Scheer as Keith &&&&& &&&&& ===Recurring=== &&&&& * Casey Wilson as Tiffany Georgina &&&&& * Horatio Sanz as Wayne &&&&& * Yassir Lester as Yassir X &&&&& * Ken Marino as The Lehman Brothers &&&&& * Kadeem Hardison as Spencer &&&&& * Eugene Cordero as Ronnie &&&&& * Julie Hagerty as Mrs. Georgina &&&&& * Phil Reeves Mr. Georgina &&&&& * Dannah Feinglass as Agent Mills &&&&& * Danielle Schneider as Agent Fox &&&&& * Bruce Dern as Rod "The Jammer" Jaminski &&&&& * Kurt Braunohler as Ty Daverman &&&&& * Melissa Rauch as Shira &&&&& &&&&& ===Guest=== &&&&& * Michael James Scott as Chad ("365") &&&&& * Hugh Dane as Calvin ("365") &&&&& * Paul Rust as Brandt ("364") &&&&& * Teresa Ganzel as Trisha ("364") &&&&& * Tim Heidecker as Not Milken #1 ("243") &&&&& * Fred Melamed as Not Milken #2 ("243") &&&&& * Vanessa Bell Calloway as Ruth ("339") &&&&& * Tim Russ as Walter Darcy ("339") &&&&& &&&&& Episodes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& ===Development=== &&&&& In 2013, Showtime began to develop the production, then titled ''Ball Street'', but did not end up moving it beyond the developmental stage.

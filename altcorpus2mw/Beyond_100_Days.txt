Beyond 100 Days &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Beyond 100 Days''''', previously known as '''''100 Days''''' and '''''100 Days+''''', is a current affairs programme that has aired on BBC World News since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. It focuses on the current US Administration, global politics, Brexit and news from around the world with attempted punches of irreverent wit and fun. The programme is presented by Katty Kay live from Washington and Christian Fraser live from London. &&&&& &&&&& Fraser occasionally presents from Brussels (during European Council meetings) and also presented from the BBC Singapore Studio for a week during the 2018 North Korea–United States summit. Kay and Fraser presented from London and Windsor for a week in May 2018 during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The programme debuted in 2017 as ''100 Days'' and aired daily to document the first one hundred days of US president Donald Trump in administration. After the first 100 days of President Trump's presidency passed, the programme continued; it was briefly called ''100 Days+'' before it was launched in September 2017 as ''Beyond 100 Days'' in the same timeslot Monday to Thursday right after Focus on Africa and BBC News at Six. ''Beyond 100 Days'' was originally an edition of ''World News Today''. &&&&& &&&&& The programme also airs on other networks. It premiered on 2 January 2018 on PBS stations in the United States. It appears that it has been cancelled on PBS after the introduction of an hour long Amanpour & Company program debuted the week of September 10, 2018. It also airs on BBC Four. &&&&& &&&&& ''Beyond 100 Days'' doesn't air for four weeks in August and for two weeks in December when Westminster and Congress are in recess; it is replaced with an edition of ''World News Today''. ''Beyond 100 Days'' is one of few BBC News programmes which is available on BBC iPlayer for more than 24 hours domestically. &&&&& &&&&& Format &&&&& ''Beyond 100 Days'' is an hour-long programme, traditionally airing at 19:00 GMT weekdays on the BBC News Channel in the UK, and at 14:00 EST weekdays on BBC World News. Every episode is opened by Katty Kay who introduces herself and then introduces Christian Fraser before reading the headlines.

She refused to continue with proceedings in the case despite the withdrawal of an application filed by Lawan, asking her to disqualify herself from the case after the Chief Judge had cleared her of the allegation in a petition as she tags the contents of the petition to be “scandalous and a challenge” on her integrity. &&&&& &&&&& As of 2014, she has spent six years as a magistrate and 11 years as a judge.

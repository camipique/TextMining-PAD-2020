Buy Me Once &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Buy Me Once''' is an online shopping website offering sustainable and durable consumer goods. The website was founded in 2016 by Tara Button, after she received a Le Creuset cooking pot and was impressed by its durability and design. The aim of the site is to encourage people to “Love Things That Last” and buy products with long lifetimes. The original website incorporates US and UK domains and stocks a range of products. In 2018 Harper Collins published ''A Life Less Throwaway'' (), a book by Button promoting the idea of "mindful curation" and her website. It is due to be published in the United States in the summer of 2018. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

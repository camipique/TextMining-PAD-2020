Construction began in April 1900. The work on the Arzamas — Romodanovo section was coordinated by engineer G. Buganov, but that target dates for opening railway to traffic had been repeatedly missed. The construction was slow. The opening of traffic from Nizhny Novgorod to Arzamas took place at the end of December 1901. However speed of passenger and freight trains was limited to 10 versts per hour (about 11 km/h). &&&&& &&&&& In 1902 the society of the Moscow-Kazan Railway presented a project of a line from Lyubertsy to Shikhrany (now Kanash) via Murom, Arzamas and Sergach with a length of 602 versts (641 km). Construction of a bridge across the Volga River was required upon the project. In 1903 the road project was finally approved, but with the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war the construction was suspended. Only in April 1910 the construction of the first road section began. The engineer A. Frolovskiy supervised the construction. The bridge across the Volga River near Kazan was designed by the famous bridge builder Professor N. Belelyubsky. The first section from Lyubertsy to Murom was opened in December 1911- The first train from Lyubertsy to Arzamas arrived on 15 October 1912. &&&&& &&&&& Emperor Nicholas II of Russia was visiting railway station.

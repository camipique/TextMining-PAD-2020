Celia Brackenridge &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Celia Brackenridge''' '''OBE''' (22 August 1950 â€“ 23 May 2018) was a British sportswoman, campaigner and academic. In the mid-1980s, Brackenridge was recognised as the most capped Great Britain lacrosse player. She founded the Women's Sports Foundation UK and also conducted research into the physical and sexual abuse of young sportspeople by coaches. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Brackenridge was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. She attended Lady Eleanor Holles School, then the Bedford College of Education to train as a physical education teacher and subsequently transferred for a year to Cambridge University, from where she graduated with a first-class honours degree in education. She was the first physical education student in the UK to graduate with a first. Brackenridge was also awarded a double blue for playing national-level lacrosse and county-level cricket. She subsequently studied for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. After graduating, she worked as a teacher at Bournemouth School for Girls and then as a lecturer at Lady Mabel College of Physical Education. &&&&& &&&&& Lacrosse &&&&& In the mid-1980s, Brackenridge was recognised as the most capped Great Britain lacrosse player. She played for England for 14 years and was captain between 1979 and 1982, including at the first Women's Lacrosse World Cup. She subsequently coached the England team. &&&&& &&&&& Research and activism &&&&& Brackenridge founded the Women's Sports Foundation UK, which is now known as the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation. She also conducted research into the physical and sexual abuse of young sportspeople by coaches, for which she received hate mail and experienced obstruction from sports governing bodies. The English Football Association agreed to provide her with funding in 2000 to investigate clubs' child protection processes and monitor the FA's junior player protection strategy, but ended the project after two years due to what were described as "budget cuts". According to an obituary published in ''The Independent'', the ending of the funding was a "result of internal disputes within the FA, and a disagreement between Adam Crozier, then FA chief executive, and Premier League clubs, which objected to the project". An obituary in ''The Sunday Times'' reflected: "As it turned out, the world of football was not ready for a gay former lacrosse international rummaging through its dirty linen". Later, Brackenridge worked with and advised organisations including UNICEF, the NSPCC, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. &&&&& &&&&& Brackenridge joined Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education in 1994, where she was professor of sport and leisure. She moved to Brunel University as professor and director of the Centre for Youth Sport and Athlete Welfare in 2005 and retired in 2010, becoming professor emerita. For her work in sports equality and child protection, Brackenridge was awarded an OBE in 2012. Between 1994 and 2010, she convened the Sexual Harassment Task Force for Women Sport International. Brackenridge's work was recognised with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 ''Sunday Times'' Sportswomen of the Year Awards. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Brackenridge's partner was Diana Woodward, with whom she entered into a civil partnership in 2006. Brackenridge died in May 2018 of leukaemia. &&&&& &&&&& Selected publications &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

So it’s a sort of, it’s an imaginary song, a fantasy song about a guy seeing someone and thinking "we should try and find a place to be alone here, and maybe exchange information and stuff, and hey you look like you flashed a smile and said to me you wanted so much more than casual conversation. So would you come on to me, or am I going to come on to you?"" &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The track was recorded at Henson Studios in Los Angeles, with additional sessions recorded at Hog Hill Mill (Sussex) and Abbey Road Studios. "Come On To Me" was also engineered by Steve Orchard, Alex Pasco, Julian Burg and Greg Kurstin. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& "Come On to Me" was released on 20 June 2018.

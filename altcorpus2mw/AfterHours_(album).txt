159	AfterHours_(album)
AfterHours (album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''AfterHours''''' is the second studio album by American R&B singer Mack Wilds. It was released on April 7, 2017, by The Ninety Five Percent and EMPIRE. The album features guest appearances from Wale, Tink and Cam Wallace. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& &&&&& The album's title was inspired by the recording process. Mack created AfterHours at night and wanted to reflect this in the content. Wilds “A lot of these songs, when I had a chance to actually record — they were recorded at night," Mack said "while I was shooting 'The Breaks' and 'Shots Fired', that was the only time I had to myself or to even get into the studio. I drew on inspiration that came from looking around and seeing how things change at night time, how things feel at night time. Text messages at 2 a.m. look different than text messages at 2 p.m. Break-ups feel different at night." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Charles-Louis Chassin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Charles-Louis Chassin &&&&& '''Charles-Louis Chassin''' (1831 – 1901) was a French historian who edited the definitive documentary collection on the War in the Vendée. &&&&& &&&&& Chassin viewed the French Revolution favourably, declaring that the Revolution's centenary demonstrated "the legitimacy of the demands of our fathers". &&&&& &&&&& Upon hearing the news of Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Chassin wrote a letter to the ''Phare de la Loire'' raising the idea of a memorial medal in Lincoln's honour, which would be sent to Mary Todd Lincoln. This was to be funded by a subscription of ten centimes and it eventually amassed 40,000 signatures (including those of Victor Hugo, Jules Michelet and Louis Blanc). &&&&& &&&&& Works &&&&& *''Les Elections et les cahiers de Paris en 1789: Documents recueillis, mis en order at annotés'' (Paris, 1888-89), 4 volumes. &&&&& *''La Préparation de la guerre de Vendée'' (Paris, 1892), 3 volumes. &&&&& *''Les Pacifications de l'Quest, 1794-1801'' (Paris, 1896-99), 3 volumes. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ayyubid–Georgian wars &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& A number of '''wars between the Kingdom of Georgia and Ayyubid Sultanate''' over the Armenian lands in eastern Anatolia, fought from 1208 until 1210. This brought the struggle for the Armenian lands to a stall, leaving the Lake Van region in a relatively secure possession of its new masters – the Ayyubids of Damascus. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& === Background === &&&&& In 1207, the Shah-Armens, former tributary state of Kingdom of Georgia was taken over by the Ayyubids, who had long coveted Khilat. The Ayyubids had come to the city at the invitation of people of Khilat after the last Sökmenli ruler, Izzeddin Balaban (r. 1206–1207) was killed by Tuğrulshah, the ruler (''melik'') of Erzurum on behalf of the Sultanate of Rûm and brother of Sultan Kayqubad I. Before Ayyubid control could be solidified, al-Awhad faced revolts in Artchesh and Van. As he attempted to quash those insurrections, Khilat joined the rebellion later in 1208. Upon the orders of al-Adid, al-Ashraf led an army of roughly 1,000 troops to support his brother al-Awhad and the Ayyubids managed to put down the revolt in Khilat, resulting in a heavy loss of life. &&&&& &&&&& === Conflict === &&&&& The neighbouring Muslim bayliks and the Georgians met the advent of the Ayyubids with mixed feelings. By 1208, Kingdom of Georgia after fomenting an Armenian revolt against the Muslim overlords challenged Ayyubid rule in eastern Anatolia and led liberational war for remaining Muslim controlled part of Greater Armenia. Georgians advanced towards Artchesh and captured the town. Malik Ahwad, afraid his own people might hand over the city to the Georgians, locked himself up in his castle. In response Sultan al-Adil assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the ''emirs'' of Homs, Hama and Baalbek as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to back al-Awhad and al-Ashraf. &&&&& &&&&& In 1210 Georgian army, under the Ivane Mkhargrdzeli reached the walls of Khilat, they besieged it and were close to taking it. Ivane rode to examine the city's wall, to divert himself. Wandering aimlessly, his horse's leg stumbled into a hidden pit and threw him to the ground. Seeing this the men of the city pounced upon him and, binding him, took him inside. They immediately informed the Sultan about his capture, at which the sultan rejoiced exceedingly, and ordered Ivane brought before him. When general Zakaria Mkhargrdzeli heard about this he sent threatening words to the citizens, saying: "''Release my brother from your city, or I shall destroy it, I will take your soil to Georgia, and destroy your population.''" Frightened by him, they requested a thirty years' truce. Ivane was released by way of ransom and had to promise the hand of his daughter Tamta to his captor. The Georgians had to lift the siege, it was this accident, so typical of al-Adil's luck, that ended the Georgian menace to Ayyubid Armenia. Georgia refrained from hostilities against enemy and the border or Christian-Muslim world was established. &&&&& &&&&& al-Ahwad died in the same year and was succeeded by his brother al-Ashraf who assumed the title of "''Shah-Armen''" (rulers of Khilat). It was he who married Tamta. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Georgian expedition to Chaldia &&&&& * Georgian expedition to Iran &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

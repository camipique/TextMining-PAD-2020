Alexander L. Rosenberg &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Alexander Lvovich Rosenberg''' (, 1946–2012) was a Russian-American mathematician who worked on functional analysis, representation theory and noncommutative algebraic geometry. He graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1973, left the Soviet Union around 1987, and was a professor at Kansas State University until 2012. &&&&& &&&&& He is known for his contributions to Tannaka duality and noncommutative algebraic geometry. He introduced several notions of spectrum for an abelian category (Rosenberg's spectrum), and the related Gabriel-Rosenberg reconstruction theorem bears his name. &&&&& &&&&& Publications &&&&& * A.

190	BatiBUS
BatiBUS &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''BatiBus''' was a network protocol for building automation that was introduced in 1989 and has since been succeeded by KNX. It was a relatively simple low-cost protocol that did not rely on dedicated chips. &&&&& &&&&& The system was run by the BatiBus Club International (BCI), which was founded by the Swiss company Landis & Gyr and the French companies AIRELEC, Electricit√© de France and Merlin Gerin (who originated the concept). Predominately used in France and captured by French Electrical Standard NF C 46620, it provided layers 1, 2 and 7 of the OSI model. Approximately 500,000 BatiBus network units were installed, mainly in France. &&&&& &&&&& BatiBus communicated over twisted pair lines and in topologies that could be divided into several segments. Each segment was powered with a 15 volt power supply rated at 150 milliamps. A device (node) could be reached at one of 240 possible addresses. In addition, 16 group addresses could be established under which all nodes in a group could be reached. The nodes avoided data collisions via CSMA/CA and had data flow controls. The maximum data transfer rate was 4800 bits/s. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

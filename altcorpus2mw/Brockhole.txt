The centre organises a number of activities, including orienteering, kayaking and open water swimming, as well as regular exhibitions. &&&&& &&&&& The site that is now the visitor centre was bought in 1896 by William Gaddum, a silk merchant from Manchester, as a summer house. He had the house built the following year, to a design by the architect Dan Gibson. The gardens were created by Thomas Mawson, known for his work in the design of gardens during the Arts and Crafts movement. Beatrix Potter was a frequent visitor to the house, and makes reference to it in her Journals. In 1946 William Gaddum died and the house was sold. In 1948 the house was converted into a convalescent home. The Lake District National Park Authority purchased the property in 1966, and in 1969 it was opened as the UK's first National Park Visitor Centre. &&&&& &&&&& Entrance to the centre and its grounds is free of charge, although a charge is made for car parking. The centre is situated off the A591 road between Windermere and Ambleside. Stagecoach bus routes 555 (Lancaster to Keswick) and 599 (Bowness-on-Windermere to Grasmere) stop outside the centre. Both these routes also serve Windermere railway station. &&&&& &&&&& In the grounds of the centre is a jetty served by a number of boat services provided by Windermere Lake Cruises between March and October.

Chicago Express Loop &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Chicago Express Loop''' is a proposed privately funded urban rail transit rapid transit system that will use underground high-speed rail to connect the Chicago Loop to O'Hare International Airport from Block 37. The line will be constructed by Elon Musk's The Boring Company and will use 16-passenger self-driving vehicles built on Tesla chassis. The vehicles will move through tunnels at speeds as high as 150 miles per hour on a concrete track and complete the journey in 12 minutes, which is 3 to 4 times faster than existing alternatives such as the Chicago Transit Authority Blue Line. The vehicles will be referred to as skates and are based on the Tesla Model X. The vehicles will cover an track with eight guiding wheels, including four traditional grounded wheels and four additional side wheels. The Boring Company will pay the costs for the construction of the system in exchange for the rights to the future transit fees as well as advertisement, branding and in-vehicle sales revenues. Chicago Express Loop is the official name of the plan. The vehicles will depart as often as every 30 seconds. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In May 2017, The Boring Company first became linked to the plan and made an official bid for the project in November 2017. The vision for electric pod transport goes back to 2017 tweets by Musk. The city's original request for proposal sought bids to bring the travel time from the loop to O'Hare below 20 minutes with departure frequencies of less than 15 minutes and fees that are lower than taxi and ridesharing fares. Bloomberg broke the story of Boring winning the bid on June 13, 2018. Musk had already applied to build a tunnel linking Los Angeles to Culver City as a “proof of process” for the technology. The Boring Company had previously received approval to link Washington, D.C. and Baltimore using this technology. &&&&& &&&&& Criticism &&&&& &&&&& The Loop's projected cost of $1 billion was derided by transportation scholars and journalists as being too low by at least a factor of 10 for its scale. The city's aldermen also raised concerns about project oversight and risk, fearing that public funds could be used to cover cost overruns. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

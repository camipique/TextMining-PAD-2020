Cinzia Casiraghi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Cinzia Casiraghi''' is a scientist who is currently Professor in Nanoscience at the School of Chemistry at the University of Manchester and National Graphene Institute in the UK. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Casiraghi's undergraduate studies took place at the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, where she obtained a BSc and an MSc in Nuclear Engineering. She read for a PhD in electrical engineering at the University of Cambridge in the UK, and followed this up with a postdoctoral positions both at Cambridge and at the Free University of Berlin, Germany. In 2008 Casiraghi was awarded the Sofja Kovalevskaya Award, a €1.65 million grant awarded to the highest quality junior researchers from outside Germany, for work concerning formation of graphene and carbon nanotubes. &&&&& &&&&& She moved to the University of Manchester in 2010, and was appointed Professor in Nanoscience in 2016, the same year that she was awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize. Casiraghi's current research includes work on printing structures based on fragments of graphene for photodetection and strain measurements. &&&&& &&&&& Outside of academia, Casiraghi has contributed to popular science segments for BBC Radio 4 and ''The Guardian''. &&&&& &&&&& Selected Publications &&&&& &&&&& * Ferrari, A.

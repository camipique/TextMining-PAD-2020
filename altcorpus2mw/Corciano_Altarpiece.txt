Corciano Altarpiece &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The altarpiece in situ. &&&&& The '''''Corciano Altarpiece''''' is a 1513 painting by Perugino now in the parish church of Santa Maria in Corciano. &&&&& It was produced following a past commission for Perugino to decorate the high altar of the parish church in Corciano. &&&&& &&&&& It shows the Assumption of Mary, with Mary herself in a contrapposto pose inside a double mandorla, surrounded symmetrically by seraphim, with two angels praying and two playing musical instruments. On the lower register are the eleven apostles, with only John the Evangelist kneeling. In the background are a clear sky and gilded treeless hills, forming a valley. &&&&& &&&&& Perugino largely used and adapted his existing drawings for the work, reusing angels from the scene of the ''Baptism of Christ'' in the Sant'Agostino Altarpiece and arranging the apostles as in the Annunziata Polyptych. The work also has a two panel predella showing ''The Annunciation'' and ''The Adoration of the Christ Child''. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:Altarpieces &&&&& category:Paintings of the Virgin Mary &&&&& category:1513 paintings &&&&& category:Paintings by Pietro Perugino &&&&& &&&&&

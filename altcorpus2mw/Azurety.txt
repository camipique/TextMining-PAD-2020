186	Azurety
Azurety &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Azurety''''' is an album by trombonist/tubist Ray Anderson, drummer Han Bennink and guitarist Christy Doran which was released on the hat ART label in 1994. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The Allmusic review by Glenn Astarita stated "On this release, the trio is simply having a blast as they surge forward with the intensity of your average high-octane, heavy metal rock outfit. ... The trio engages in uninhibited dialogue in concert with ominous sounding undercurrents thanks to a rollicking and rolling presentation of pieces spanning bluesy, dirge-like progressions and turbulently executed exchanges. ... The musicians also provide the listener with softly enacted swing vamps along with some downright riotous interplay.

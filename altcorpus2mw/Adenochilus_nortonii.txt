Its labellum has red bars and a central band of yellow calli. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Adenochilus nortonii'' is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a long, thin, horizontal rhizome and a single egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide with reddish spots on the lower surface. A single white flower long and wide is borne on the end of a flowering spike tall. The outer surface of the sepals and petals is covered with reddish glandular hairs. The dorsal sepal is broad elliptic in shape, long, wide and forms a hood over the labellum and column. The lateral sepals are long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are long, about wide and slightly erect. The labellum is strongly curved when viewed from the side, about long and wide, with three lobes with red bars. The middle lobe is narrow with a dense central band of yellow calli and the side lobes are broader. Flowering occurs in November and December. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy and naming &&&&& ''Adenochilus nortonii'' was first formally described in 1876 by Robert FitzGerald from a specimen collected near Mount Victoria and the description was published in his book ''Australian Orchids''. The specific epithet (''nortonii'') honours James Norton (1824-1906), an amateur botanist and friend of Fitzgerald. &&&&& &&&&& Distribution and habitat &&&&& The white gnome orchid grows in rock crevices, in sphagnum and near creeks in beech forest, usually above .

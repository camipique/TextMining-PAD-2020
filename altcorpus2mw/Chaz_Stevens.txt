Chaz Stevens &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Chaz Stevens''' (born August 31, 1964) is an American entrepreneur, activist, and a blogger. He is the executive director of The Humanity Fund which focuses on the separation of the church and state, as Stevens disagrees with all religious expression on government property. He also launched the Gay Pride Festivus Pole Generosity Fund, in 2015, with donations supporting various LGBT youth organizations. He brought down two-fifths of Deerfield Beachs ruling body including, Mayor Al Capellini and Commissioner Steve Gonot. &&&&& &&&&& In 2013, he first made the headlines on winning the right to install a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer cans Festivus pole at Florida's state Capitol in Tallahassee. He is popularly known for his ways of attempting to keep religion out of the government. Stevens is also the CEO of ESADoggy. &&&&& &&&&& Religious Beliefs &&&&& Stevens describes himself as an atheist. He runs his own church and proclaims himself as the bishop of the Church of Satanic Activism. &&&&& &&&&& Activities &&&&& &&&&& === 2012 === &&&&& Stevens began celebrating the fictitious holiday known as Festivus in 2012, when he set up a pole next to the Nativity Scene and Menorah, in his hometown of Deerfield Beach. &&&&& &&&&& === 2013 === &&&&& Stevens petition for erecting a Festivus pole at the Florida Capitol building in Tallahassee, alongside the buildings Christmas tree and Nativity Scene, was granted. He erected a Pabst Blue Ribbon Festivus Pole in the Florida Capitol rotunda. &&&&& &&&&& This made headlines of international media during the holiday season, with segments airing on The Colbert Report, Daily Show, and Fox News. &&&&& &&&&& === 2015 === &&&&& He wrapped the Festivus poles in the colors of gay pride and displayed in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Washington, and Oklahoma. He changed the design of the pole after the Supreme Court ruled in the favor of gay marriage. &&&&& &&&&& === 2016 === &&&&& The Satanic Temple announced to deliver the invocation at the February 17 Phoenix City Council meeting. The Phoenix City Council voted 5-4 to start its meetings with a moment of silence instead of a religious prayer. Sal DiCiccio, Phoenix City Council, lashed out in the news was not happy about the decision of banning all prayer at council meetings. Stevens, following the Phoenix scene, sent him a butt plug saying that he is going to push back whenever he sees government stupidity. &&&&& &&&&& === 2018 === &&&&& Stevens seeks to install a Shinto phallic sculpture in response to requests by local rabbis in Hallandale, FL to erect a series of poles creating an eruv on city property. The eruv would require the installation of nine poles to create an invisible extension to Jewish homes thereby allowing the families to accomplish specific tasks otherwise prohibited on the Sabbath - a religious loophole. In response to this request Stevens threatened to erect a "big happy dong" which is part of the Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, ("Festival of the Steel Phallus") held each spring at the Kanayama Shrine in Kawasaki, Japan on the first Sunday in April. Stevens said he plans to 'come to town with a platoon of giant dongs' should the eruv win approval, one for each of the nine poles. &&&&& &&&&& As reported by Miami Herald in July 2018, "Chaz Stevens...threatened to install 'a big happy dong on public property' if an eruv gets approved in Hallandale Beach." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

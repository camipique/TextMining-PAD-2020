309	Aletia_inconstans
Aletia inconstans &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Aletia inconstans''''' is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is found in both the North and South Islands but is considered a rare species. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& &&&&& This species was described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1880 using material collected by W. Skellon in Blenheim and named ''Spaelotis inconstans''. George Hudson discussed this species in his 1898 book ''New Zealand moths and butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera)'' as a synonym of ''Leucania griseipennis.'' He again discussed as well as illustrated the species in his 1928 book ''The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand'' under the name ''Aletia inconstans.'' The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. &&&&& &&&&& The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the genus ''Aletia'' is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. It is likely that this species will be removed from the genus ''Aletia'' and be placed within one of the following genera: ''Physetica'', ''Graphania'', ''Tmetolophota'' or ''Ichneutica''. As such the species is currently also known as ''Aletia'' (''s.l.'') ''inconstans''. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Butler described the species as follows: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Distribution &&&&& &&&&& This species is endemic to New Zealand. Other than the type locality of Blenheim, this species has been found near the Buller River in the Westcoast, at Quail Island and Hinewai Reserve in Canterbury, and near Coronet Peak, at Tara Hills Research Station, and at Ida Valley in Otago. This species has also been located in the North Island at Mount Taranaki, Waiouru and Wellington. &&&&& &&&&& Biology and behaviour &&&&& &&&&& This species is regarded as being rare. It is on the wing from November to February. This species is attracted to light and has been collected via light trapping. It has also been collected through sugar trapping. &&&&& &&&&& Habitat and host species &&&&& &&&&& ''A. inconstans'' prefers to inhabit open areas near forest or shrubland. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

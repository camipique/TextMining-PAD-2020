Blue Camel &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Blue Camel''''' is an album by the Lebanese oud player and composer Rabih Abou-Khalil . The album fuses traditional Arabic music with jazz. It was recorded in 1992 and released on the Enja label. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The Allmusic review by Kurt Keefner stated "''Blue Camel'' is the pinnacle to date of Lebanese oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil's achievement as a jazzman. In both mood and scope, it can almost be characterized as a new ''Kind of Blue''. Both tense and reflective, it is perfect for listening after midnight ... ''Blue Camel'' may not be a perfect album, but it demonstrates better than any other that a fusion between jazz and a musical form from another culture is possible and can work to the advantage of both. Plus, it's just great listening". Metal Reviews said "The album glories in crafting a successful blend of Arabian music and jazz: a very homogeneous and enjoyable fusion with enough shift in mood and method to keep things interesting". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All compositions by Rabih Abou-Khalil &&&&& # "Sahara" – 8:18 &&&&& # "Tsarka" – 6:45 &&&&& # "Ziriab" – 6:49 &&&&& # "Blue Camel" – 8:20 &&&&& # "On Time" – 6:19 &&&&& # "A Night in the Mountains" – 8:37 &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Rabih Abou-Khalil – oud &&&&& *Kenny Wheeler – flugelhorn, trumpet &&&&& *Charlie Mariano – alto saxophone &&&&& *Steve Swallow – bass &&&&& *Ramesh Shotham – South Indian drums, percussion &&&&& *Milton Cardona – congas &&&&& *Nabil Khaiat – frame drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Chief Tonasket Log Cabin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Chief Tonasket Log Cabin''' is a log cabin in Okanogan County, Washington, once the home of Chief Tonasket, born 1822. It is along Washington State Route 21 near Curlew, Washington. Tonasket moved to the Colville Indian Reservation, now the Old North Half in the Curlew area, after signing the 1883 treaty with the United States. Tonasket died in 1891, and the structure was operated as the "Curlew Store" for a period of time by G.S. Helphry and J. Walters, beginning in 1896, supplying prospectors coming to the Okanogan gold rush. &&&&& &&&&& The original structure was approximately long and was expanded and framed in when the Curlew Store was put up. The store was dismantled when the Great Northern Railway came through the area and the original log cabin uncovered. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& ===Sources=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * Treaty with the Columbia's and Colvilles, Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1886 (treaty text) &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&

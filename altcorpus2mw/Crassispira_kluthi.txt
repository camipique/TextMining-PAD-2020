Crassispira kluthi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Crassispira kluthi''''' is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pseudomelatomidae. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The length of the shell varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. &&&&& &&&&& This unpretending little species is easily recognized by its black colour and faint sculpture. A row of small tubercles ascends the spire, scarcely discernible on the last whorl, which (as in ''Crassispira rudis'') descends and rises again at the aperture, making the spire-oulines curvilinear. The first three whorls are smooth. The surface shows extremely fine lines of growth, faintly decussated by spiral striae. The outer lip is sharp, not serrated, with a swelling behind. The anterior sinus is very distinct, as in ''Strombus''. The posterior notch is deep. The sutural callosity is large, joining the well-developed inner lip. The operculum is shaped as in ''Drillia maculosa'', with more or less of a reddish tinge. The spire is generally incrusted with blackish mud, sometimes bearing round flat egg-cases, pierced in the middle. &&&&& &&&&& Distribution &&&&& This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off Panama; fossils were found in Pleistocene strata of the Gulf of California. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& * d' Orbigny, Sagra's Hist.

It originated in either Havana or Varadero as a variety of a traditional Cuban guava-based drink. In Cuba, the drink is commonly served (along with either a Cubata or Mojito) as a pre-dinner ''coctel''. The Cuban variety of the cocktail commonly uses extra guava nectar in place of grenadine syrup, and the drink normally contains Havana Club rum. Outside of Cuba, many recipes call for the use of Bacardi White Rum. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * List of cocktails &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

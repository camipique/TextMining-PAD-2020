Brightlingsea Station &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Brighlingsea Naval Station'''  was a naval station and military formation of the British Royal Navy located at Brightlingsea, Essex, on the East Coast of England. It was a sub-area command under the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore from 1914 to 1921 and again from 1939 to 1945. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In World War One Brightlingsea naval base was in charge of the protective anti-torpedo net barrier around the Swin Anchorage, used at various times by the 3rd Battle Squadron, the Dover Patrol, and other naval units. It installed, maintained and finally dismantled the booms and nets, patrolled around them, and also patrolled the local Essex river estuaries and coastline, using trawlers, drifters, MLs (Motor Launches) and motor boats. After mid-1916 it was also the base for the steam gunboat . The local shipyards also maintained its craft and some of those from the Dover Patrol. A Rear-Admiral (C L Napier) was in command from late 1914 till Spring 1916, then a Commander (R Hartland Mahan). Including the old light cruiser which was attached in 1915-1916, manpower varied from about 300 to 500. The shore base was initially named HMS Wallaroo (after the ship), then City of Perth (after a net drifter). &&&&& Unconnected with the Navy was the Army School of Military (Field) Engineering, and from Summer 1916 the Australian Engineer Training Depot (AETD), with a combined strength of up to 1400 personnel. &&&&& &&&&& In early 1940 naval personnel and craft from HMS Vernon, Portsmouth, used the harbour to test the newly-invented LL magnetic mine sweep. That June, after their departure, the Navy set up the HMS Nemo shore base, for Essex-coast auxiliary patrol. In the autumn minesweeping drifters and training landing craft were attached, together with naval air-sea rescue craft, and personnel for operating and guarding estuary observation minefields. Manpower ashore and afloat varied from about 200 to 600. &&&&& A separate Coastal Forces equipping unit was also attached (from 1941), which used the local shipyards to equip and test-run many hundreds of MLs, MTBs and MGBs. The same shipyards also serviced and repaired many such craft from other bases, besides building 16 in the case of Aldous's yard. &&&&& In 1942 landing craft training was separated out under HMS Helder, which moored its craft (up to 90) in the Creek but had its shore HQ opposite at St Osyth. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& &&&&& Brightlingsea is a coastal town in the Tendring district of Essex, England. It is situated between Colchester and Clacton-on-Sea, at the mouth of the River Colne, on Brightlingsea Creek. &&&&& &&&&& Administration &&&&& The station was administered initially by the Rear-Admiral, Brightlinsea and later by the Senior Naval Officer, Brighlingsea &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& &&&&& Flag Ship &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Brighlingsea Station''' &&&&& &&&&& HMS Wallaroo (1914-1915), HMS City of Perth (1916-1939), HMS Nemo (1940-1945) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Rear-Admiral, Brightlingsea=== &&&&& Included: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Flag &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& &&&&& Term  &&&&& &&&&& Notes/Ref &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Rear-Admiral, Brightlingsea''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& Rear-Admiral &&&&& &&&&& 25px &&&&& &&&&& Charles Lionel Napier &&&&& &&&&& November 1914 - May 1916 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Naval Officer-in-Charge, Brightlingsea=== &&&&& '':Incomplete list of post holder included'': &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Flag &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& &&&&& Term  &&&&& &&&&& Notes/Ref &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Naval Officer-in-Charge, Brightlingsea''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& Captain &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& J.

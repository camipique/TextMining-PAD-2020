Christina Warinner &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Christina Warinner''' is an American anthropologist best known for her research on the evolution of ancient microbiomes. She is Presidential Research Professor, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, and Adjunct Professor of Periodontics at the University of Oklahoma. Warinner is also a Research group leader at Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Christina Warinner obtained a PhD from Harvard University in 2010. From 2010 – 2012, Warinner completed postdoctoral training at the University of Zurich's Centre for Evolutionary Medicine. Warinner's research explored the relationship between disease, diet and the environment by analyzing DNA extracted from ancient dental plaque. &&&&& &&&&& Wariner furthered her postdoctoral studies at the University of Oklahoma from 2012 to 2014. She was hired as Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Presidential Research Professor at the University of Oklahoma in 2014. "A top priority in Warinner's laboratory is to compile a DNA inventory built from the plaque found on corpses in museum collections and archaeological sites from around the world with the goal of discovering how human health and diet have changed throughout history." &&&&& &&&&& Since 2016, Warinner has led a research team in the archaeogenetics department at Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. Warinner's research focuses on ancestral human microbiomes. Recent projects include "Dairying and Dietary Adaptive Evolution in Prehistory", "Evolution and Ecology of the Human Gut Microbiome" and "Evolution and Ecology of the Human Oral Microbiome". Research she led found the exotic mineral Lapis Lazuli in the plaque of a female skeleton found in a cemetery in Dalheim in Germany. A 2017 report detailed that the plaque dating from 1100 AD contained fragments of this bright blue paint pigment indicates that women as well as men were involved in creating illuminated manuscripts. It is presumed that the woman was licking her brush as she worked painting bright blue. &&&&& &&&&& Warinner has published research in leading scholarly journals including Nature Genetics, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Journal of Human Evolution, and the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Her research findings were included among the top 100 scientific discoveries of 2014 by Discover Magazine. Her work has been featured in Science, Scientific American, the LA Times, the Guardian, and CNN, among others. Warinner was named a TED fellow in 2012 and a US National Academy of Sciences Kavli Fellow in 2014. She gave a TED talk in February 2012 on the evolution of infectious disease and diet in humans. In January 2013 Warinner gave a TEDx talk titled "Debunking the Paleo Diet". &&&&& &&&&& Selected publications &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& * 2014 – Honorable Mention for the International Society for Evolution, Medicine & Public Health's Omenn Prize &&&&& * 2014 – US National Academy of Sciences Kavli Fellowship &&&&& * 2012 – TED Fellowship &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Christina Warinner Ted Lecture "Tracking ancient diseases using plaque" &&&&& * Christina Warinner Ted Lecture "Tracking ancient diseases using ... plaque" &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Conference of the Birds (play) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Conference of the birds''' is a music theatre play, performed in the Netherlands in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Origin &&&&& Conference of the Birds is the English translation of the title of an old Persian poem: منطق الطیر, '''''Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr''''', or مقامات الطیور, '''''Maqāmāt-uṭ-Ṭuyūr'''''). In the poem it is told how all birds of the world came together to look for Simoerg, king of the birds. After a tough journey, a small part of the birds reached their destination. The birds symbolize the wandering human soul.. &&&&& &&&&& Dutch Theatre &&&&& In the Netherlands Falk Richter made a music theatre script based on the poem, which was performed in summer 2018 in Leeuwarden (one of the two European Capitals of Culture that year). The play was part of the activities of Leeuwarden-Fryslân 2018. . Hundreds of Frisian amateur musicians played during the spectacle, as well as the musician Eric Vloeimans, and dancers and actors of Noord Nederlands Toneel and Club Guy & Roni. The music of the play was composed by Sytze Pruiksma; director was Guy Weizman. &&&&& &&&&& The play was part of the project "King of the meadows" (Kening fan ‘e Greide) around the threatened position of the Black-tailed godwit &&&&& &&&&& The play aimed to address three issues: the detoriation of nature, the importance of art and (regional) culture and the power of the collective. Although the audience was enthousiastic about the play, not every one could appreciate the explicit normative message on bird protection &&&&& &&&&& Other versions &&&&& Various other theatre versions of the Conference of the birds exist.

Anastasia Soare &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Anastasia Soare''' (née ''Bălămaci''; born 1957/58) is a Romanian-American billionaire businesswoman, and the CEO and founder of Anastasia Beverly Hills, known as the "Eyebrow Queen". &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Soare was born in Constanţa, Romania. She is the only child of Dumitru Bălămaci (who died when she was 12) and Victoria Babu, who owned a tailoring shop. She studied art history and architecture in Romania. &&&&& &&&&& In 1986 when the ship was docked in Italy, her husband, the ship's captain, visited the American embassy and asked for asylum, and he reached the United States six months later. It was not until three years later, in 1989 at the age of 32, that Soare and her daughter were allowed to leave Romania to join him. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& In Los Angeles, as she spoke very little English, Soare worked as an aesthetician at a beauty salon and soon realized that eyebrows were an under-exploited area, "I developed a technique for how to shape eyebrows according to people's bone structure and natural eyebrow shape". As her manager did not think there was enough of a market, she rented a room in a Beverly Hills salon, providing facials, body waxing, and eyebrow sculpting. By 1997, she was running her own salon on Beverly Hills' Bedford Drive. As a beautician, she has stated that her first two clients for an eyebrow treatment were Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. Other clients have included Faye Dunaway and Jennifer Lopez. &&&&& &&&&& Soare is the CEO and founder of Anastasia Beverly Hills beauty brand, available in almost 2,000 stores internationally. In 2016, Soare stated that she owned 100% of the company. &&&&& &&&&& As of January 2019, Anastasia Beverly Hills had the most popular Instagram page in the beauty industry, with 18.6 million followers. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2018, ''Forbes'' estimated Soare's net worth at $1 billion. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In 1978, she married Victor Soare, a ship's captain. They had one daughter together, Claudia Norvina Soare, and divorced in 1994. Her daughter is also active in the business. &&&&& &&&&& She lives in Beverly Hills, California, US. &&&&& &&&&& Soare is also the godmother of actor Sebastian Stan. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

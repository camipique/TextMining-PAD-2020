Andrea Luka Zimmerman &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Life and Career &&&&& Andrea Luka Zimmerman grew up on several large public housing estates, including the Wohnring in Neuperlach, Germany, and left school at 16. After moving to London in 1991, she studied at Central Saint Martins for a PhD. She co-founded the cultural collectives Fugitive Images and Vision Machine (collaborators on Academy Award® nominated feature documentary ''The Look of Silence''). Vision Machine was created in 2001 as an experimental filmmaking collective with the aim to research, analyse and respond to the conditions and mechanisms of economic, political and military power. Its members were Christine Cynn, Joshua Oppenheimer, Michael Uwemedimo, Andrea Luka Zimmerman. Zimmerman ia co-founder of the cultural collective Fugitive Images, alongside Lasse Johansson and David Roberts in 2009. &&&&& &&&&& Andrea Zimmerman's feature films are ''Taskafa, Stories of the Street'' (2013, 66 minutes), which explores resistance and co-existence through the lives of the street dogs of Istanbul and is voiced by John Berger. ''Estate, a Reverie'' (2015, 83 minutes) tracks the passing of the Haggerston Estate in East London and the utopian promise of social housing it once offered, with a celebration of everyday humanity. ''Erase and Forget'' (2017, 88 minutes) is a documentary portrait of "Bo" Gritz, which presents a "study of the multiple expressions of Gritz’s life against the backdrop of post-Vietnam America, gun culture, and the nascent alt-right". It premiered at the 2017 Berlin Film Festival. &&&&& &&&&& Art exhibitions and projects include ''i am here'', a public artwork in Haggerston, Hackney, which was made in response to the experience of living on a council estate which was being gentrified. For this, large photos of residents from the estate were placed over the windows of vacated flats, with the intention of opening up a "reflective space concerning issues about visibility and 'urban regeneration'." ''Real Estates'' (co-curated with David Roberts), PEER with LUX, London (2015), was a multifaceted project around issues of housing, social justice and public space in East London. ''Common Ground,'' Spike Island, Bristol (2017) comprised an exhibition, screening, talks and discussions around strategies of social and cultural resistance and ways of living together . ''Civil Rites'' (2017) was made in response to a speech given by Martin Luther King at Newcastle University, and was first shown at Tyneside Cinema Gallery in Newcastle in 2017/18, and London Open triennial at Whitechapel Gallery in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Filmography &&&&& &&&&& *''The Delmarva Chicken of Tomorrow'' (short, 2003) &&&&& *''The Globalisation Tapes'' (2003) (additional editor and camera)a collaboration between the Independent Plantation Workers' Union of Sumatra, the International Union of Food and Agricultural Workers (IUF), and Vision Machine &&&&& *''The Last Biscuit'' (short, 2005) a collaboration with Paul Hallam &&&&& *''The Ramp'' (short, 2010) &&&&& *''Merzschmerz'' (Film and Video Umbrella) (short, 2012) &&&&& *''Towards Estate'' (short, 2012) &&&&& *''Taskafa, Stories of the Street'' (2013) &&&&& *''Estate, A Reverie'' (2015) &&&&& *''More Utopias Now'' (Channel 4 Random Acts), (short, 2016) &&&&& *''Lower Street, a Night’s Journey'' (Tintype) (short, 2016) &&&&& *''Civil Rites'' (Tyneside Cinema) (short, 2017) &&&&& *''Erase and Forget'' (2017) &&&&& *''Here For Life'' (Artangel) (2019) a collaboration with Adrian Jackson &&&&& &&&&& Exhibitions and Projects &&&&& *''i am here'' (Zimmerman, Johansson, Fennell), large scale public art work on the Haggerston Estate (2009–2014) &&&&& *''Real Estates'' (co-curated with David Roberts), PEER Gallery, in association with LUX, London (2015) &&&&& *''Common Ground'' (solo), Spike Island, Bristol (2017) &&&&& *London Open (group), triennial at Whitechapel Gallery (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& *Co-author of ''Estate: Art, Politics and Social Housing in Britain'': Myrdle Court Press,'''' 2010 &&&&& *Contribution in ''Truth, Dare or Promise: Art and Documentary Revisited''.

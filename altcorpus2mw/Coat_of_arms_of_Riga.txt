The walls of the medieval towns' marble with the gates were a common heraldic element that symbolized the city's independence, significance and power. &&&&& &&&&& In 1297-1330 when the Livonian Order became the Riga City Council, a new seal was created. The walls with the raised gates and the crossed keys remain from the old version, but with a different location. New heraldic elements, such as cross of the Livonian Order was inserted into the coat of arms to symbolize symbolising the dominance of the Livonian Order in Riga,and replaced the crossed staves. Other new element, a lion in the raised stone gates of the city, was added, which symbolises to the prowess of the townspeople and the growing independence of the citizens of Riga. This coat of arms was created in 1347 and has been preserved in a 1349 document stamp and is considered to be the basis for development of the Riga Coat of Arms. &&&&& &&&&& In 1554, the coat of arms of the city of Riga was supplemented with a new heraldic element, lions, as the shield holders of the coat of arms. &&&&& &&&&& In 1656, the city acquired the right to place the Swedish crown in its coat of arms as a form of gratitude from the for the heroic defense of the city during the siege of Russia. The color of the white coat of arms was changed to blue, but the order of the cross red color - with gold. Such coat of arms was kept in the Riga stamp seal until 1889. &&&&& &&&&& After the Northern War, when Riga was under the control of the Russian Empire, the Russian Tsarina Catherine II approved the coat of arms of Riga in 4 October 1788. The shield holders of the lions were replaced by the symbol of the Russian Empire - the two-headed eagle's, and the crown of the Monarch of Sweden with the Russian imperial crown. &&&&& &&&&& On October 31, 1925, with the approval of the President, Riga received a new coat of arms, the description of which is as follows: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In the years of the Latvian SSR, there was little attention to the coat of arms of Riga, and the new coat of arms was approved on 15 February 1967, designed by Ivars Strautmanis. It had a coat of arms with a golden border in the color of the flag of the Latvian SSR, with a 2-tower-shaped silhouette of the city gate (the silhouette was added more details in 1987). Above the gate is 2 crossed keys and a yellow star. The establishment year of Riga, "1201", was added later in 1968, and was deleted in a 1987 revision, and was changed with the lions below the gate in 1988. &&&&& &&&&& Current coat of arms &&&&& After Latvia regained independence, Riga regained its historical coat of arms, and the approval in 1925 was renewed in 1988. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& Siegel riga 1225.png|Seal of Riga in 1225 &&&&& Siegel riga 1349.png|Seal of Riga in 1347 &&&&& Siegel riga 1368.png|Seal of Riga in 1368 &&&&& Münze riga 1586.png|Seal of Riga in 1586 &&&&& Coat of arms of Riga (1660-1721).gif|Coat of arms of Riga from 1660 until 1721 &&&&& Großes wappen riga 1.png|Coat of arms of Riga in 1707 &&&&& Siegel riga 1707.png|Seal of Riga in 1707 &&&&& &&&&& === Governorate of Livonia === &&&&& &&&&& Wappen riga 1723.png|Coat of arms of Riga in 1723 &&&&& Wappen riga 1788.png|Coat of arms of Riga in 1788 &&&&& Wappen riga 1904.png|Coat of arms of Riga in 1904 &&&&& &&&&& === Republic of Latvia (1918-1940) === &&&&& &&&&& Großes wappen riga 1923.png|Coat of arms of Riga, created in 1923 and approved on 31 October 1925 &&&&& &&&&& === Latvian SSR === &&&&& From 1988 until 1990, there was no official version of the coat of arms.

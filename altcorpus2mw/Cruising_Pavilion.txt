Cruising Pavilion &&&&& Introduction &&&&& This is a photo of the Cruising Pavilion art exhibition from the Venice Bienalle of Architecture 2018. &&&&& '''Cruising Pavilion''' is an art exhibition that explored the places and practices of casual sex. It was an unofficial offering of the 16th Venice Biennale of Architecture and ran from 24 May - 1 July 2018. &&&&& &&&&& The exhibition &&&&& &&&&& The exhibit sought to depict places where gay men historically looked for casual sex and hookups, including "non-conventional venues such as parking lots, parks, bathroom stalls, and dark rooms." The design of the exhibition included glory holes, a semblance of dark rooms, and aspects seeking to demonstrate aspects of hooking-up including narrow stairs and multiple levels. The show presented ways LGBT people "have shaped space and the ways in which architecture has therefore in turn shaped space for them." Cruising as a practice and the spaces in which it happens were explored and made safe in the exhibition, all while challenging the heteronormativity commonly expressed in the Venice Biennale of Architecture itself. This is especially dramatic given the implications of online and dating apps such as Grindr. &&&&& &&&&& The artists &&&&& &&&&& Cruising Pavilion was curated by Pierre-Alexandre Mateos, Rasmus Myrup, Octave Perrault and Charles Teyssou. The curators self-funded the exhibition to confront this LGBT subculture that had not been explored through architecture. Installations included works by Alison Veit, Andreas Angelidakis, Andrés Jaque / Office for Political Innovation, Atelier Aziz Alqatami, Carlos Reyes, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, DYKE_ON, Etienne Descloux, Hannah Quinlan & Rosie Hastings, Henrik Olesen, Ian Wooldridge, S H U Í (Jon Wang & Sean Roland), Lili Reynaud Dewar, Pascal Cribier & Louis Benech, Monica Bonvicini, Studio Karhard, Studio Odile Decq, Özgür Kar, Pol Esteve & Marc Navarro, Prem Sahib, Tom Burr, Trevor Yeung. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Cruising Pavilion website &&&&& *  ''FREESPACE'', the Biennale Architettura 2018 &&&&& * From Vatican Chapels to a Gay Culture Pavilion—See Highlights From the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer while Simon Harper remains as the executive producer. Kate Oates became the show's senior executive producer from October 2018, and was promoted to Head of Continuing Drama six months later. Raffety's resignation from her position was announced on 16 April 2019. Raffety confirmed that there would be a series 33 in an interview with ''TVTimes'', where she billed the series as the "Year of the Paramedic". In preparation for the series, two new paramedic characters were introduced to the drama. &&&&& &&&&& It was announced on 24 July 2018 that the series would begin on 11 August 2018 with an episode described as "one of the biggest episodes in the show's history." It was previously revealed, in May 2018, that the show was filming scenes which would feature a motorway crash and a petrol tanker turning on its side. Sophie Dainty of entertainment website ''Digital Spy'' reported that there would be an explosion, which would leave one main character's life "hanging in the balance". An official statement from the show stated that the ED's paramedic crew would "face their darkest day" in the episode. Charlotte Salt, who portrays Sam Nicholls, told Elaine Reilly of ''What's on TV'' that the episodes were filmed at night over two weeks with night shoots lasting over 13 hours. On the atmosphere on-set while filming, she commented, "there's a certain buzz in the air..." The episode sees Sam die after suffering a fatal bleed from the crash, which sparks a new story for Iain as he struggles to cope with his grief. A show trailer, released on 12 August, teased "a new era" for the hospital following Sam's death. The trailer previewed Iain's guilt, the appearances of Zsa Zsa and Omo, Eddie facing trial for Alicia's rape, and upsetting scenes for Charlie and Duffy. On 16 November 2018, it was revealed via ''Casualty'' official Instagram page that the show would be receiving a new set of titles. The revamp came into effect from episode 13, which aired on 17 November 2018, replacing the show's former titles, which were introduced back in series 31. &&&&& &&&&& === Crossovers === &&&&& This series features crossover events with ''Holby City'' sister show ''Casualty''. In August 2018, Raffety told Dainty (''Digital Spy'') that Harper enjoys the crossover events between the two dramas and wanted to produce more. She also teased some "extremely exciting crossovers" within the series. In a December 2018 interview with Dainty, Harper promised further crossovers between ''Holby City'' and ''Casualty'', and teased an "exciting" event to be aired in spring 2019. ''Holby City'' cast member Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian "Fletch" Fletcher), who appeared in ''Casualty'' between 2012 and 2014, makes a crossover appearance in episode 31. &&&&& &&&&& Guy Henry appears in the crossover event as Henrik Hanssen. &&&&& On 15 February 2019, it was announced that ''Casualty'' would crossover with spin-off series ''Holby City'' for two episodes in March as part of the year-long twentieth anniversary celebrations for ''Holby City''. The episodes are billed as "dramatic and action-packed". Both episodes were written by Michelle Lipton and directed by Steve Brett. The episodes see the hospital attacked by a cyber-virus, destroying all electric systems. A predominant story in the episodes follows Connie and ''Holby City'' character Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) saving the lives of colleagues after two separate major incidents, despite only having one available theatre. Harper described the episode as "pure, nail-biting, taut, emotional medical drama". He also praised the production teams of both shows for their logical creation of the episodes, and looked forward to exploring the interactions between the characters from the two shows. &&&&& &&&&& Nine ''Casualty'' cast members - Mealing (Connie Beauchamp), Durr (David Hide), Stevenson (Iain Dean), Ryan (Gem Dean), Mohan (Rash Masum), Jafargholi (Marty Kirkby), Griffiths (Elle Gardner), Marshall (Noel Garcia), and Hill (Ruby Spark) - feature in the ''Holby City'' episode of the crossover, originally broadcast on 5 March 2019. The ''Casualty'' episode of the crossover, episode 26 of this series, features the ''Casualty'' cast alongside twelve ''Holby City'' cast members - Marcel (Jac Naylor), Bob Barrett (Sacha Levy), Hugh Quarshie (Ric Griffin), Guy Henry (Henrik Hanssen), Catherine Russell (Serena Campbell), Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian "Fletch" Fletcher), Kaye Wragg (Essie Di Lucca), Jaye Jacobs (Donna Jackson), Marcus Griffiths (Xavier "Xav" Duval), Nic Jackman (Cameron Dunn), Camilla Arfwedson (Zosia Self), and Belinda Owusu (Nicky McKendrick) - and two ''Holby City'' guest actors - Francesca Barrett as Beka Levy and Naomi Katiyo as Darla Johnstone. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& The drama was nominated in the "Best Soap (Evening)" category at the 2018 ''Digital Spy'' Reader Awards; it came in last place with 3.8% of the total votes. &&&&& &&&&& Episodes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Footnotes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * ''Casualty'' Series 33 at BBC Online &&&&& * ''Casualty'' series 33 at the Internet Movie Database &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

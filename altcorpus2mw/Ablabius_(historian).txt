184	Ablabius_(historian)
Ablabius (historian) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Ablabius''' (lived around 4th-5th-century AD) was a historian of the Goths. &&&&& &&&&& Who Ablabius was and exactly how he lived is not known. Since Jordanes relies on his work when writing Getica, he must have lived some time in the 6th-century AD or even the 5th-century AD. It has been suggested that the work of Ablabius was the first written history of the Goths, and that this formed the basis of a more detailed account written by Cassiodorus. It is likely that Jordanes used the work of Ablabius directly, but a intermediate source can not be ruled out either. According to Jordanes the work of Ablabius relied on folk songs and legends. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& * Peter J. Heather: ''Goths and Romans'' 332–489.

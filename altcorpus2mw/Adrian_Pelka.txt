However, the middleman ostensibly let the opposition dispossess him and have a penalty in a 1â€“5 crushing by MyPa, leading to suspicion of match manipulation three years later especially since Malaysian William Bee Wah Lim was discovered to have bet on a defeat by four-goals in favor of MyPa. At the time, the club officials did not suspect him but severely criticized him for the errors. &&&&& &&&&& In total, he made 2 Veikkausliiga appearances during the 2005 season. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * FuPa Profile &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

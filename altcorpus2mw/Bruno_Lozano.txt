Bruno Lozano &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Bruno "Ralphy" Lozano''' is an American politician and the mayor of Del Rio, Texas. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Lozano was born in Del Rio in the early 1980s. He served as a former security forces patrolman in the U.S. military. During his time with the US Air Force, he was tasked with enforcing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell, notifying gay service members of their discharge. As a result, Lozano, who is gay, said he chose not to reenlist. He worked as a flight attendant thereafter. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Lozano was already known in his town for his effort to clean up waterways. According to Lozano, however, he only decided to enter political life in 2016, pressed by his former high school classmates during a class reunion party. He was critical of the town hall's economic policies, which he says left the local economy stagnant and dependent on the US military for employment even as neighboring cities boomed. He called on Millennial voters to break Baby Boomers' hold on local political power. &&&&& &&&&& A Democrat, he ran against incumbent mayor Robert Garza on a May 5th, 2018 election, and won in a landslide, receiving 62% of the votes. A later recount confirmed the result. &&&&& &&&&& His victory received attention in ''The Huffington Post'' and the national LGBT press, which highlighted both his military career and his flamboyant image. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Burt Katz &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Burton D. Katz''' (7 July 1937, Chicago – 30 April 2016) was a pizza-maker and owner of Burt's Place, a Morton Grove, Illinois, pizza restaurant. Burt and his wife Sharon achieved worldwide fame in 2009 after being featured on a Chicago-themed episode (5th episode of Season 5) of Anthony Bourdain's television documentary series ''No Reservations''. &&&&& &&&&& Katz grew up in the Wicker Park, Chicago, neighborhood. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and studied history at Roosevelt University. On their honeymoon, starting in December 1962, Burt and Susan Katz went on a year-long, around-the-world honeymoon, which was reported in many international newspapers. In 1963 Katz became an owner-partner in an Evanston restaurant, but sold his share in 1965. Katz then opened on Chicago's Howard Street a pizzeria, Gulliver's, selling it in 1968. He then left the restaurant business but returned in 1971, opening Pequod's in Morton Grove. After working 80 to 90 hours a week for 15 years he sold Pequod's in 1985 — the new owners of Pequod's later opened a second location on Chicago's N. Clybourn Avenue. &&&&& &&&&& In 1989 Burt and Sharon Katz opened the restaurant Starback's, which was renamed Burt's Place because of possible trademark conflict with Starbucks. Burt was the sole operator in the kitchen, while Susan was the sole operator for the dining room with customer reception and orders. Due to Burt's health problems, Burt's Place closed in 2015. A photograph of a slice of pizza from Burt's Place was featured on the cover of the October 2007 issue of the magazine ''Saveur'' with an accompanying article; a huge reprint of the cover was displayed on the wall next to the kitchen entry way. In 2012, based upon a survey involving 85,000 votes, the editors of the magazine ''Men's Health'' selected Burt's Place as the USA's Best Pizza Parlor. In 2017 Burt's Place was reopened by Jerry Petrow and John Munao, who were selected and trained by Burt Katz when he was dying of cancer. &&&&& &&&&& Upon Burt Katz's death he was survived by his widow, three children, and six grandchildren; he was predeceased by one grandchild. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

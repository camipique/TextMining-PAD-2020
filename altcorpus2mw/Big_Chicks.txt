The restaurant next door, Tweet, is also owned by Fire and provides food to Big Chicks. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& Big Chicks is owned by Michelle Fire and located in Uptown, Chicago. The name of the bar was inspired by an experience Fire had on a trip to India, where she was referred to as "Big Chick," by men in Bandra. Big Chicks opened on December 11, 1986. Prior to Fire purchasing the bar, it had been a veteran's bar and when Fire took over, she inherited the clients, their dogs and the original bartenders. Big Chicks has been open every day since first opening as of 2016. Over time, the bar has become an "informal gay community center" in Uptown. Fire welcomed everyone in the LGBT community, straight people and people in various kink communities.

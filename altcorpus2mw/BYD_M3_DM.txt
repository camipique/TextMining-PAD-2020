It was never actually made available to the market, but Chinese government officials such as post offices were able to acquire fleets to be used as state-financed vehicles. The T3 name was originally used on a truck or commercial van version of the BYD e6 prototype. However the vehicle that was finally released wearing the BYD T3 nameplate shares the platform with the BYD M3. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See Also &&&&& &&&&& ;Chinese-made Alphard clones: &&&&& &&&&& * Gonow Xinglang - First Chinese-made NV200 clone in 2013. &&&&& * Refine M3 - Second Chinese-made NV200 clone in 2014. &&&&& &&&&& ;Original Japanese-made van: &&&&& * Nissan NV200 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * Official BYD T3 site , Singapore &&&&& * BYD T3 detailed info &&&&& * BYD M3 (Shang) detailed info &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

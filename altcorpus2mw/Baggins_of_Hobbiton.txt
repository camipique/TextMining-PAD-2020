Baggins of Hobbiton &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& In J.R.R. Tolkiens' legendarium, the '''Baggins of Hobbiton''', more commonly referred to as the Baggins family, were a hobbit family that lived in the village of Hobbiton. Important members included Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins. &&&&& &&&&& Profile &&&&& The Baggins family lived in the Shire, mostly in or near the town of Hobbiton. Evidently aristocratic landowners, they intermarried extensively with the two titled families of the Shire, the Tooks and the Brandybucks. It seems likely that the Bagginses were the major landowners and leading family of the area around Hobbiton. They were seen as respectable (indeed, as more respectable than the aristocratic Tooks) until Bilbo Baggins set out on the quest of Erebor with Gandalf the Grey and thirteen Dwarves: when he returned he was seen as odd or queer, but also extremely rich. Bilbo adopted his "nephew" Frodo Baggins, who inherited the ''smial'' of Bag End after Bilbo left. Frodo himself was involved in the quest of ''the Lord of the Rings'', which ended the War of the Ring. &&&&& &&&&& Origin &&&&& The Baggins Family traced their origin to one "Balbo Baggins", who was born in or near Hobbiton in S.R 1167. His wife, who founded the Baggins Family with him was one ""Berylla Boffin". &&&&& &&&&& Connection with other hobbit families &&&&& ===Bolger=== &&&&& The Bolgers and the Bagginses had a large connection. In fact, 5 of out 15 Bolger marriages were to Bagginses. &&&&& &&&&& ===Boffin=== &&&&& The Boffins and the Bagginses had a huge connection. This is because the Bagginses, were descendants of one ''Berylla Boffin'', who was a Boffin herself. Thus, the Boffins and the Bagginses were kin to each other. The Baggins family could also be considered a ''branch'' of the Boffin Family. &&&&& &&&&& ===Tooks=== &&&&& The Bagginses married the Tooks many times, and from these marriages would come some of the great hobbits in the War of the Ring. Also, the Bagginses with Took blood were more adventurous. &&&&& &&&&& Family Branches &&&&& There were two known branches of the Baggins Family. These were the Chubb-Bagginses and the Sackville-Bagginses. This happened when a female head of a family marries a male of another family. In order for the female's maiden name to be preserved through her descendants, a double surname is given. &&&&& &&&&& ===Chubb-Baggins=== &&&&& This double surname was first given to Falco Chubb-Baggins. His mother was Chica Chubb, the head of the Chubb family at the time when she married Bingo Baggins, and this gave Falco the surname Chubb-Baggins. The Chubb-Baggins family ended with the marriage of Poppy Chubb-Baggins (the only child of Falco) married Filibert Bolger, thus ending the surname. The Chubb-Bagginses were also kin to the Tooks, as they were related Adamanta Took (whose maiden name was Chubb). &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Sackville-Baggins=== &&&&& This double surname was first given to Otho Sackville-Baggins. His mother was Camellia Sackville, the head of the Sackville family at the time when she married Longo Baggins, and this gave Otho the surname Sackville Baggins. The Sackville-Baggins family ended in S.R 1420 (T.A 3020), at the death of Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, the wife of Otho. They were closely related to the Chubb-Bagginses, as Longo was Bingo's brother. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Family Tree of the Baggins &&&&& Below is a family tree of the Baggins Family. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& The word Baggins is actually a translation of the Westron word, ''Labingi'', which was related to the Westron word ''laban'', meaning bag. The name is associated with Bag End. &&&&& &&&&& ===Translations=== &&&&& In the translations of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, the name Baggins is translated to other languages, while keeping the ''bag'' meaning. &&&&& &&&&& *In the German translation the family name is Beutlin. &&&&& *In the Dutch translation it is Balings. &&&&& *In the French translation it is Sacquet in most books, but Bessac in the new ''Hobbit'' translation. &&&&& *In the Norwegian translation it is Lommelun. &&&&& *In the Finnish translation it is Reppuli. &&&&& *In the Spanish translation it is Bolsón. &&&&& *In the Swedish translation it is Bagger. &&&&& *In the Portuguese translation it is Bolseiro. &&&&& *In the Frisian translation it is Balsma. &&&&& *In the Hungarian translation it is Zsákos. &&&&& *In the Czech translation it is Pytlík. &&&&& *In the Slovak translation it is Bublík. &&&&& *In one of the Polish translations it is Bagosz. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Charles P. Rettig &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Charles P. Rettig''' (born November 18, 1956) is a tax controversy specialist and Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On September 12, 2018, the United States Senate confirmed Rettig's nomination to be IRS commissioner for the term expiring November 12, 2022. Rettig was sworn in on October 1, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& Rettig earned a BA in economics from UCLA, a JD at the Pepperdine University School of Law and an LL.M. in Taxation at the NYU School of Law. &&&&& &&&&& Pre-IRS legal career &&&&& Rettig was a partner at the Beverly Hills tax law firm of Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher & Perez, P.C. He worked at the firm for over 36 years, where he represented individuals and corporations before federal and state taxing authorities. The firm has 11 attorneys and was established in 1960. &&&&& &&&&& Rettig held leadership roles in a number of professional organizations. He was President of the American College of Tax Counsel (ACTC); was Chair of the 4,000+ member Taxation Section of the State Bar of California from 1999–2000; was the longtime Chair of the UCLA Extension Annual Tax Controversy Institute; and most recently served as Vice-Chair, Administration, for the 12,000+ member Taxation Section of the American Bar Association. &&&&& &&&&& In 2010–2011, Rettig was appointed by the IRS to serve as Chairman of the IRS Advisory Council (IRSAC) for the last year of his three-year term. The IRSAC's primary purpose is to provide an organized public forum for senior IRS executives and representatives of the public to discuss relevant tax administration issues. &&&&& &&&&& Commissioner &&&&& On February 13, 2018, Rettig's nomination was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Finance. &&&&& &&&&& During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on June 28, 2018, Rettig "told lawmakers he would ensure that the agency is 'impartial and non-biased from top to bottom' and follows the law." The committee approved his nomination on July 19, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Rettig's nomination was confirmed by the full Senate on September 12, 2018. Secretary Mnuchin administered the oath of office to Rettig on October 1, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Rettig's annual budget at the IRS is a relatively minuscule $11 billion. In June 2012, the IRS Oversight Board recommended to Treasury a Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 budget of $13 billion for the IRS. In fiscal year 2018, the U.S. federal government spent $782 billion more than it brought in. It is estimated that in fiscal year 2019 the loss will be close to $1 trillion. &&&&& &&&&& In FY 2019 the IRS plans to cut 2,200 employees. In Rettig's FY 2020 budget request, he plans to cut an additional 1,800 employees. Since FY 2010, staffing &&&&& decreased by about 19 percent, primarily in compliance and enforcement. &&&&& &&&&& In January 2015, the editorial board of ''The New York Times'' called the IRS budget cuts penny-wise-and-pound-foolish, where for every dollar of cuts in the budget, $6 were lost in tax revenue. &&&&& &&&&& Other activities &&&&& In his home state of California, Rettig was a longtime member of the California FTB Advisory Board. He was designated a Certified Specialist in Taxation Law by the State Bar of California, Board of Legal Specialization and also designated a Certified Specialist in Estate Planning, Trust & Probate Law by the State Bar of California, Board of Legal Specialization. He is a Past-Member of the Board of Trustees for the California CPA Education Foundation. &&&&& &&&&& Rettig is active in numerous civic and philanthropic activities. He co-founded the UCLA Extension Vets Count Scholarship Fund, designed to provide scholarships for active duty and retired military personnel who are working to realize their career goals in tax, accounting, wealth management, and other areas of the financial services industry as well as basic coursework for personal growth in budgeting, financial literacy, and investing. Also, according to his official IRS bio, he's "active in the Wounded Warrior Project, Advance Guard." The Advance Guard is a charitable "monthly giving program" in which participants donate a minimum of $19 per month by check or credit card. According to Rettig's law firm biography on the website of his former firm, he's an associate member of the Academy of Magical Arts. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Cops Shot the Kid &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Cops Shot the Kid'''" is a song by American rapper Nas, featuring fellow rap artist Kanye West, from his eleventh studio album, ''Nasir'' (2018). &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& This track doesn't mark West's only guest appearance on the featuring album, since he is also featured on "Everything". Nas took to Instagram shortly after the song had generated attention as a standout from the album and paid homage to Slick Rick, since he's sampled and behind the inspiration for it. &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& For the background vocals saying: "The cops shot the kid" throughout the vast majority of "Cops Shot the Kid", a sample from "Children's Story" by Slick Rick is used. The speech in the track's intro is sampled &&&&& from a scene including Richard Pryor in 1973 Stax Records film ''Wattstax''. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& The song received mostly positive reviews. ''NME'' described it as being: 'a track full of evocative images', and labelled the Rick sample as being both 'breathless' and 'frantic'. ''Rolling Stone'' viewed "Cops Shot the Kid" as being the album's 'most cogent song' and branded West's appearance as a 'lone guest verse'. &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& Upon the release of ''Nasir'', the track debuted at number 96 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. This made it the only song from the album to enter that chart. &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

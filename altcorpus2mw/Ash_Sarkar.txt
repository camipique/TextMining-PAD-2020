Ash Sarkar &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Ash Sarkar''' (born 17 April 1992) is a British journalist and political activist. She is a senior editor at Novara Media and teaches at Anglia Ruskin University and the Sandberg Institute. &&&&& &&&&& Sarkar is a contributor to the ''The Guardian'' and ''The Independent'' and is a regular commentator on politics and society in UK broadcast and online media, appearing on shows including ''Question Time'', ''Good Morning Britain'', Sky News, Channel 4, ''Daily Politics'', and ''Newsnight''. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Sarkar grew up in North London and was raised by her mother. She attended a comprehensive school before moving to a selective grammar school for sixth form education. She gained undergraduate and masters degrees in English Literature from University College London. &&&&& &&&&& Political views &&&&& After a clip of her telling Piers Morgan on ''Good Morning Britain'' that she was "literally a communist!" went viral, Sarkar clarified her views as libertarian communist, a "long termist" who supports Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's anti-austerity policies. &&&&& &&&&& In her writings and commentary, Sarkar has expressed anti-imperialist, feminist and anti-fascist views. She has taken part in anti-racist, anti-fascist and anti-Trump protests (the subject of her interview with Morgan) and joined a hunger strike to protest against the detention of asylum seekers at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre. She supported the Stansted 15's actions against deportation flights. Sarkar voted to remain in the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. She has described herself as a "lexiter at heart" who joined a "ragtag coalition of progressive tendencies" against what had become a project of the anti-immigration hard right. &&&&& &&&&& Sarkar's writing and broadcasting makes liberal use of humour and London slang, and she has written that politics "should be joyful and exuberant." &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Sarkar lives in North London and is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter. She is a Muslim. &&&&& &&&&& === Family === &&&&& Sarkar's great-great-aunt, Pritilata Waddedar, was a Bengali nationalist who participated in armed struggle against the British Empire in 1930s Bengal. Her grandmother is a hospital carer. Her mother is a social worker who was an anti-racist and trade union activist in the 1970s and 1980s, helping to organise marches after the racially motivated murder of Altab Ali. Sarkar says that, as a child, her mother briefly met Mao Zedong while in Beijing. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Although she is not a Labour Party member, Sarkar (and Novara Media more generally) has become closely associated in media commentary with Jeremy Corbyn's democratic socialist project: ''The Times'' has described her as "Britain's loudest Corbynista", and ''Dazed'' magazine said she is one of "the voices resetting the political agenda in the UK". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * Independent - Ash Sarkar &&&&& * The Guardian - Ash Sarkar &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

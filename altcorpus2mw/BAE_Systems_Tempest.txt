BAE Systems Tempest &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''BAE Systems Tempest''' is a proposed stealth fighter aircraft concept to be designed and manufactured in the United Kingdom for the Royal Air Force. It is being developed by a consortium known as ''"Team Tempest,"'' consisting of the UK Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA, and is intended to enter service from 2035 replacing the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in service with the RAF. Â£2 billion (approximately $2.66 billion) will be spent by the British government on the project by 2025. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& The Tempest was announced by the British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson on 16 July 2018 at the Farnborough Airshow as part of the Combat Air Strategy. Tempest will be a sixth-generation jet fighter incorporating several new technologies. &&&&& &&&&& It has been reported that BAE systems is planning to approach the Government of India and the Indian Air Force regarding collaboration for the design and manufacture of the Tempest. &&&&& &&&&& The RAF had a similarly named fighter in the Second World War which also followed a Typhoon. &&&&& &&&&& Design &&&&& Tempest will be able to fly unmanned, and use swarming technology to control drones. It will incorporate artificial intelligence deep learning and possess directed-energy weapons. Another piece of technology being designed into Tempest is so-called Cooperative Engagement Capability, the ability to cooperate on the battlefield, sharing sensor data and messages to coordinate attack or defence. Tempest will feature an adaptive cycle engine and a virtual cockpit shown on a pilot's helmet-mounted display. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Future Combat Air System &&&&& *Future of the Royal Air Force &&&&& *BAE Systems Replica &&&&& *Mikoyan MiG-41 &&&&& *F/A-XX Program &&&&& *New Generation Fighter &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

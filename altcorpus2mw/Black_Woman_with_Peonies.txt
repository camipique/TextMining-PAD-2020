Black Woman with Peonies &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Black Woman with Peonies''''' is a painting by Frédéric Bazille, produced in late spring 1870, a few months before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, in which he would die. It has been in the Musée Fabre in Montpellier since 1918. &&&&& &&&&& Bazille created another, similar, image with the same model, currently in the collection of the National Gallery of Art: &&&&& &&&&& File:Young Woman with Peonies A32212.jpg|''Young Woman with Peonies'', 1870 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Both paintings make use of peonies. This was one of the flowers his friend Édouard Manet was particularly proud of that grew in his garden, and the same model with peonies appears in the background of Manet's ''Olympia'' that is considered his most famous work. Bazille seems to have wanted to bring that model to the foreground, and both of his paintings clearly show her having charge of the flowers, rather than as the recipient of flowers herself. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

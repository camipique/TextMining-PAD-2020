She had two siblings: an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Irene. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Klein began her radio as a singer in the late 1920s. However, demand for her talents with dialect and as a character actress led her to acting full-time by 1933. &&&&& &&&&& Klein performed in a variety of radio programs, including roles in ''Terry and the Pirates'', ''Meet Mr. Meek'', ''We, The Abbotts'', ''The House on Q Street'', and ''Sometime Before Morning''. Klein was best known for her use of dialects in radio performances. &&&&& &&&&& Klein’s radio performances led to performances on stage. Klein had roles in eight Broadway productions, including ''Brooklyn, U.S.A.'' (1942), ''Uncle Harry'' (1942), ''The Immoralist'' (1954), and ''Jane Eyre'' (1958). Her film credits included ''The Naked City'' (1948) and ''The Enforcer'' (1951). She was signed to play the role of Martha in director Otto Preminger's ''Where the Sidewalk Ends'' and scenes were shot in New York City, but the role was ultimately played by another actress. &&&&& &&&&& Klein had roles on numerous television shows, including ''The Boris Karloff Mystery Playhouse'' (1949), ''Studio One in Hollywood'' (1949), ''The Ford Theatre Hour'' (1950), and ''The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse'' (1950). &&&&& &&&&& Blacklist &&&&& In the mid-1940s, Klein was active in the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA) and served as a delegate for New York at national conferences in 1943 and 1944.

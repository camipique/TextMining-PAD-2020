Abstract differential equation &&&&& Introduction &&&&& In mathematics, an '''abstract differential equation''' is a differential equation in which the unknown function and its derivatives take values in some generic abstract space (a Hilbert space, a Banach space, etc.). Equations of this kind arise e.g. in the study of partial differential equations: if to one of the variables is given a privilegiate position (e.g. time, in heat or wave equations) and all the others are put together, an ordinary "differential" equation with respect to the variable which was put in evidence is obtained. Adding boundary conditions can often be translated in terms of considering solutions in some convenient function spaces. &&&&& &&&&& The classical abstract differential equation which is most frequently encountered is the equation &&&&& : &&&&& where the unknown function belongs to some function space , and is an operator (usually a linear operator) acting on this space. An exhaustive treatment of the homogeneous () case with a constant operator is given by the theory of C0-semigroups. Very often, the study of other abstract differential equations amounts (by e.g. reduction to a set of equations of the first order) to the study of this equation. &&&&& &&&&& The theory of abstract differential equations has been founded by professor Einar Hille in several papers and in his book ''Functional Analysis and Semi-Groups.'' Other main contributors were K≈çsaku Yosida, Ralph Phillips, Isao Miyadera and Selim Grigorievich Krein. &&&&& &&&&& Abstract Cauchy problem &&&&& ===Definition=== &&&&& Let and be two linear operators, with domains and , acting in a Banach space . A function is said to have '''strong derivative''' (or to be '''Frechet differentiable''' or simply '''differentiable''') at the point if there exists an element such that &&&&& : &&&&& and its derivative is . &&&&& &&&&& A '''solution''' of the equation &&&&& : &&&&& is a function such that: &&&&& * &&&&& *the strong derivative exists and for any such , and &&&&& *the previous equality holds . &&&&& The '''Cauchy problem''' consists in finding a solution of the equation, satisfying the initial condition . &&&&& &&&&& ===Well posedness=== &&&&& According to the definition of well-posed problem by Hadamard, the Cauchy problem is said to be '''well posed''' (or '''correct''') on if: &&&&& *for any it has a unique solution, and &&&&& *this solution depends continuously on the initial data in the sense that if (), then for the corresponding solution at every &&&&& A well posed Cauchy problem is said to be '''uniformly well posed''' if implies uniformly in on each finite interval . &&&&& &&&&& ===Semigroup of operators associated to a Cauchy problem=== &&&&& To an abstract Cauchy problem one can associate a '''semigroup''' of operators , i.e. a family of bounded linear operators depending on a parameter () such that &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Consider the operator which assigns to the element the value of the solution of the Cauchy problem () at the moment of time . If the Cauchy problem is well posed, then the operator is defined on and forms a semigroup. &&&&& &&&&& Additionally, if is dense in , the operator can be extended to a bounded linear operator defined on the entire space . In this case one can associate to any the function , for any . Such a function is called '''generalized solution''' of the Cauchy problem. &&&&& &&&&& If is dense in and the Cauchy problem is uniformly well posed, then the associated semigroup is a C0-semigroup in . &&&&& &&&&& Conversely, if is the infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup , then the Cauchy problem &&&&& : &&&&& is uniformly well posed and the solution is given by &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Nonhomogeneous problem &&&&& The Cauchy problem &&&&& : &&&&& with , is called '''nonhomogeneous''' when . The following theorem gives some sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution: &&&&& &&&&& '''Theorem.''' If is an infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup and is continuously differentiable, then the function &&&&& : &&&&& is the unique solution to the (abstract) nonhomogeneous Cauchy problem. &&&&& &&&&& The integral on the right-hand side as to be intended as a Bochner integral. &&&&& &&&&& Time-dependent problem &&&&& The problem of finding a solution to the initial value problem &&&&& : &&&&& where the unknown is a function , is given and, for each , is a given, closed, linear operator in with domain , independent of and dense in , is called '''time-dependent''' Cauchy problem. &&&&& &&&&& An operator valued function with values in (the space of all bounded linear operators from to ), defined and strongly continuous jointly in for , is called a '''fundamental solution''' of the time-dependent problem if: &&&&& *the partial derivative exists in the strong topology of , belongs to for , and is strongly continuous in for ; &&&&& *the range of is in ; &&&&& * and &&&&& *. &&&&& is also called evolution operator, propagator, solution operator or Green's function. &&&&& &&&&& A function is called a '''mild solution''' of the time-dependent problem if it admits the integral representation &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& There are various known sufficient conditions for the existence of the evolution operator . In practically all cases considered in the literature is assumed to be the infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup on . Roughly speaking, if is the infinitesimal generator of a contraction semigroup the equation is said to be of ''hyperbolic type''; if is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup the equation is said to be of ''parabolic type''. &&&&& &&&&& Non linear problem &&&&& The problem of finding a solution to either &&&&& : &&&&& where is given, or &&&&& : &&&&& where is a nonlinear operator with domain , is called '''nonlinear Cauchy problem'''. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * C0-semigroup &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

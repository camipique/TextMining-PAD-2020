America (George Adams album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''America''''' is an album by saxophonist George Adams which was recorded in 1989 and released on the Blue Note label the following year. &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states "This is one of tenor saxophonist George Adams' funnest records. He takes eight songs, all of which now qualify as American folk songs (along with two originals), and gives them melodic but inventive treatments. "... This CD is accessible, patriotic, and a highly recommended and continually surprising set". In the Los Angeles Times, Don Heckman called it "an unusual contemporary jazz outing" and wrote "Tenor saxophonist Adams takes an interesting risk with this collection of songs from what he calls the "mainstream of Americana." ... For the most part, it pays off. Adams' big blowzy sound and brusquely rhythmic articulation bring a vigorous, almost folk-like slant to these familiar songs". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& # "America the Beautiful" (Samuel A.

CardiacSense Ltd &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& CardiacSense is a developer of a wearable technology for continuous cardiac arrhythmia detection and non-inflating blood pressure monitoring. CardiacSense is based in Caesarea, Israel. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& CardiacSense Ltd is a private limited company founded in 2009. The company formerly developed a device for heart rate reading during sport activities and refocused on medical devices in 2015. CardiacSense’s device monitors heart rate for the purpose of detecting heart disorders such as atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest. The device comes in the form of a watch. It monitors blood pressure (continuously and cuff-less) and measures oxygen saturation, skin temperature, and additional vital signs. &&&&& &&&&& Technology &&&&& CardiacSense technology combines Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors along with a unique mechanics, and algorithm. The PPG is an optical sensing technique that measures changes in fluid (blood) volume. The company developed a proprietary optical solution as well as an artifact sensor that improve the accuracy by eliminating movement artifacts in PPG sensor. The device has a continuous monitoring capacity of over a year. In case of arrythmia, such as a-fib, the watch alerts the user and send messages to the patient’s physician. The user’s data is saved in the watch memory and uploaded to a cloud application via the user’s cellular device. &&&&& &&&&& The watch will be issued by prescription and the physician can choose if and when to be notified. &&&&& &&&&& CardiacSense completed a clinical trial at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in 2016. &&&&& &&&&& They are currently in the last stages for receiving the CE and FDA certifications for A-Fib. &&&&& &&&&& Capitalization &&&&& CardiacSense has raised approximately $3.6 million through angel investors and one public company up to 2017 and an additional $4.5 million in 2018-2019. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

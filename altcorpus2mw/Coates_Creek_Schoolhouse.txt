Coates Creek Schoolhouse &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Coates Creek Schoolhouse''' is a historic one-room log schoolhouse in rural Mesa County, Colorado, on a county road known as DS Road, about west of the hamlet of Glade Park, Colorado. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. &&&&& &&&&& It is a log structure built in 1919 by local homesteader Elwood Brouse. It was used as a school from 1919 to 1971 and was used for church services and Sunday school until 1985. &&&&& &&&&& After the road was relocated, the school was dismantled and moved in 1926 about southwest to its current location, where the new road crosses Coates Creek. It was expanded somewhat when rebuilt but was still one room. In 1942 it was expanded by addition of a cloakroom and the interior was lined by plywood. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

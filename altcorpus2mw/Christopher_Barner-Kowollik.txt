Christopher Barner-Kowollik &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Christopher Barner-Kowollik''' (born 1973) is an Australian Research Council (ARC) Laureate Fellow and professor within the School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) journal Polymer Chemistry, the Head of the Soft Matter Materials Laboratory at QUT and research team leader at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& After his undergraduate studies of chemistry at the Universities of Constance and Goettingen (Germany), Christopher Barner-Kowollik received a PhD in Physical Chemistry (Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Goettingen in 1999. Following postdoctoral research with Prof. Tom Davis at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, he held academic positions at the Centre for Advanced Macromolecular Design (CAMD) and was appointed Full Professor of Polymer Chemistry in 2006 at the same institution. In 2008 he moved back to Germany, where he became the chair for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). At the KIT he was the founding director of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1176 'Molecular Structuring of Soft Matter' established by the German Research Council (DFG). While he relocated in 2017 to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), where he was awarded an Australian Laureate Fellowship, Christopher Barner-Kowollik continuous to head a research group at the KIT. &&&&& &&&&& Research &&&&& Initially the research of Christopher Barner-Kowollik was situated in the field of polymer chemistry and polymer reaction kinetics. His research has expanded towards the fusion of polymer chemistry with organic and photochemistry. Ongoing research includes the photochemical synthesis of highly defined macromolecular architectures, the development of 2D and 3D photolithographic processes as well as their applications in biosystems including single cell scaffolds. &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& &&&&& * 2017 Australian Laureate Fellowship, Australian Research Council (ARC) &&&&& * 2016 Erwin Schrödinger Award of the Helmholtz Association in recognition of the body of work on “3D Laser Printing of Functionalized Microstructures”, jointly with M.

Anthon-Oto Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Anthon-Oto Community School District''' was a school district headquartered in Anthon, Iowa. The district, in Woodbury County, served Anthon and Oto. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Anthon and Oto school districts consolidated in 1959 to form the Anthon-Oto district. Each city had one campus; both cities had elementary grades, Oto had grades 7-8 for junior high school, and Anthon had grades 9-12 for senior high school. A fire destroyed the Anton campus on Wednesday, December 29, 1965. A new secondary school in Anton was dedicated on September 29, 1968. The elementary grades were consolidated to Oto in 1974. A new elementary school replacing the Oto school was built in Anthon from fall 1980 until the opening on August 27, 1981; it was connected to the secondary building. &&&&& &&&&& Circa 1993 the district began whole grade-sharing with the Maple Valley Community School District; the two districts sent their own children to each others' schools, with each operating its own elementary school, Anthon-Oto operating the middle school, and Maple Valley operating the high school. The two districts also shared superintendents, teachers, and athletic facilities. In 2010 Anthon-Oto had about 250 students while Maple Valley had about 505 students. &&&&& &&&&& The first merger election between the two districts came in 2005. Maple Valley voters favored the deal but Anthon-Oto voters turned it down, partly due to fear of being politically dominated by the larger Maple Valley and also because they were unwilling to pay for a new high school in the Maple Valley area. The second merger was scheduled for February 1, 2011. On July 1, 2012 Anthon-Oto merged with Maple Valley to form the Maple Valley Anthon-Oto Community School District. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

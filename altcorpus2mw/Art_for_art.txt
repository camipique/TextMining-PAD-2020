Art for art &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Art for art''' is a contemporary international art movement. &&&&& &&&&& Categorization &&&&& Art for art is one of the latest movements in visual contemporary art, represented by a group of American and European artists from the urban art generation. They work in different styles and techniques, but hold to the same ideology, supporting the idea of the value and significance of the piece of art as an act of creation and self-expression. The work of art is seen as a self-sufficient product independent from the personality of its creator. This movement denies the social influence of the artist’s name on the artwork’s true value, but relies on the principle of anonymity in art, hence the name of the movement "Art for art" that underlines the elimination of the artist from the work. The term 'Art for Art' is also associated with the deliberate abandonment of the art elitism and returning to its initial decorative and aesthetic functions. Such artists usually hide their real identities under monickers and thus conceal the personal data that can influence the judgement of their works. &&&&& &&&&& Artists that belong to the Art for art movement are Harry Carlson, John Atwood, Bertha Delisi, Alice Zimermann, Patrick Duchamp etc. Art for art movement can aso be linked to such art trends as Street art, Video art, Performance, and others &&&&& &&&&& The term 'Art for Art' was first officially used in 2016 as the name of the Art Exhibition in Monaco, although this direction, as an association of independent artists, had existed long time before. &&&&& &&&&& A 2018 exhibition in Moscow received significant media attention. &&&&& &&&&& Exhibitions &&&&& * Monaco, 2016 &&&&& * Brussels, BFAF, 2017 &&&&& * Luxembourg, ART3F, 2017. &&&&& * Moscow, RA&AF, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Gallery Cart Art Foundation &&&&& * International contemporary art fair &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

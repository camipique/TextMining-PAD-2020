Alberg 22 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Alberg 22''' is a Canadian sailboat, that was designed by Swedish naval architect Carl Alberg and first built in 1970. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& The design was built by Nye Yachts in Belleville, Ontario, later located in Bloomfield, Ontario, Canada. A total of 180 examples were completed before production ended. &&&&& &&&&& Design &&&&& Alberg 22 &&&&& The Alberg 22 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wooden handrails and toe rails, plus other trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. Due to its weight and full keel it has been noted as handling like a larger boat. &&&&& &&&&& The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor of up to for docking and maneuvering. The outboard motor is fitted to a transom well and the lazarette has space for the fuel tank. &&&&& &&&&& Accommodations are provided for four people in a forward "V"-berth and two quarter berths. The gallery is equipped with a sink with a water pump and a removable icebox. &&&&& &&&&& Fitted equipment includes genoa tracks and winches, as well as a halyard winch. &&&&& &&&&& The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 282 with a high of 276 and low of 288. It has a hull speed of . &&&&& &&&&& Operational history &&&&& In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, "This full keel boat has the proportions of a classic sailboat. It was designed by Carl Alberg, who earned a reputation for drawing extremely seaworthy sailboats. In fact, some people who are now sailing Alberg 30s and 37s got their start with the Alberg 22. The Alberg 22 heels over fairly easily at first, but it reaches a point where it locks in and goes. The full keel and high ballast displacement ratio (almost 50%) suggests that this boat should be able to handle some rough conditions." &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of sailing boat types &&&&& &&&&& '''Related development''' &&&&& *Cape Dory 22 &&&&& &&&&& '''Similar sailboats''' &&&&& *Buccaneer 220 &&&&& *Capri 22 &&&&& *DS-22 &&&&& *Edel 665 &&&&& *Falmouth Cutter 22 &&&&& *Hunter 22 &&&&& *J/22 &&&&& *Marlow-Hunter 22 &&&&& *Marshall 22 &&&&& *Pearson Electra &&&&& *Pearson Ensign &&&&& *Ranger 22 &&&&& *Santana 22 &&&&& *Spindrift 22 &&&&& *Starwind 223 &&&&& *Tanzer 22 &&&&& *Triton 22 &&&&& *US Yachts US 22 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

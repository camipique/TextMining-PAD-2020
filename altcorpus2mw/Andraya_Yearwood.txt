Andraya Yearwood &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Andraya Yearwood''' is an American transgender student athlete from Connecticut. Yearwood began competing on the girls' team in early AprilÂ 2017 and won first place in the girls 100- and 200-meter dashes. Yearwood's second-place finish at the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC) 100-yard dash finals on June 4, 2017, behind another transgender student, gained international media attention. In 2018, writing on the subject of transgender people in sports, ESPN called Yearwood and a handful of other transgender athletes "focal points in a fight over the future of sports". The decision of the State of Connecticut to allow Yearwood to compete on the women's team is a focus of debate surrounding Title IX and trans people. She has received recruitment interest from Harvard, UConn, and Penn University to play track and field in NCAA. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

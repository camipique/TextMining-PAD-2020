CD28 family receptor &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''CD28 family receptors''' are a group of regulatory cell surface receptors expressed on immune cells. The CD28 family in turn is a subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily. &&&&& &&&&& Two family members, CD28 and ICOS, act as positive regulators of T cell function while another three, BTLA, CTLA-4 and PD-1 act as inhibitors. Ligands for the CD28 receptor family include B7 family proteins. &&&&& &&&&& Clinical significance &&&&& &&&&& Some cancer cells evade destruction by the immune system through of B7 ligands that bind to inhibitory CD28 family member receptors on immune cells. Antibodies directed against CD28 family members CTLA-4, PD-1, or their B7 ligands function as checkpoint inhibitors to overcome tumor immune tolerance and are used clinically in cancer immunotherapy. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

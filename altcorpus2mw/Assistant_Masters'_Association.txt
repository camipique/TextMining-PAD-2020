104	Assistant_Masters'_Association
Assistant Masters' Association &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Assistant Masters' Association''' (AAM) was a trade union representing male teachers in British secondary schools. &&&&& &&&&& The union was founded in 1891 as the '''Incorporated Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools''', although it soon became the "Assistant Masters' Association", a counterpart to the Association of Assistant Mistresses (AAM). Membership of the union grew steadily, reaching 3,259 in 1910, and about 40,000 by 1978. &&&&& &&&&& From 1978, single-sex trade unions were prohibited, and the AMA accordingly merged with the AAM, forming the Assistant Masters' and Mistresses' Association. &&&&& &&&&& General Secretaries &&&&& :1921: G.

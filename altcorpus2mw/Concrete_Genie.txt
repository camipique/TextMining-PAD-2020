Concrete Genie &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Concrete Genie''''' is an upcoming action-adventure game developed by PixelOpus, a developer part of SIE Worldwide Studios, for the PlayStation 4. The game was announced at Sony's PlayStation Media Showcase at Paris Games Week 2017 on October 30, 2017. Creative director Dominic Robillard says the game is heavily inspired by Sega's ''Jet Set Radio''. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& &&&&& The story takes place in a small town named Denska, which has been mostly abandoned and polluted. A young boy named Ash regularly doodles in his notebook. A group of bullies steals the book, rips out the pages and scatters them throughout the city. Ash goes on a quest to recover his pages. Along this quest, he discovers a paint brush that can bring his creations to life. Ash must overcome the bullies and bring life back to his hometown. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& &&&&& The player controls Ash and uses the DualShock 4's motion controls to create landscapes in the town of Denska. These landscapes turn into living portraits. How you paint creatures and what color you paint them will affect their personalities. For example, red paint will grant a creature fire-breathing abilities. In addition to free-style drawing, there is a set of core puzzles in the game that the player will have to solve through their artwork. &&&&& &&&&& The player will be able to gain more access of Denska over time, but at the start of the game, the player will only have access to a single neighborhood. Throughout the game, the bullies will move through the town and cause the artwork to die. They can also bully Ash, so the player must avoid the bullies as Ash traverses the town. The player can also fix the ruined artwork. &&&&& &&&&& Project manager Brent Gocke says the game will be between five and six hours long. The developer is currently looking into a multi-player component to the game. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

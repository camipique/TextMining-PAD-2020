Pupils of Children's school of arts and Children's art school of Blonskaya have prepared an exhibition of drawings according to works by the writer. The best artists were entrusted with the honour of opening the monument &&&&& &&&&& Vandal’s history &&&&& On the night of September 13, 2010, the monument along with the pedestal was turned upside down by unknown vandals and its head was broken. The barbarians obviously did not pursue material goals, because they threw the beaten head of the bronze boy near the turned monument. On the night of August 27, 2012, the figure of Artyomka was torn from the pedestal. The unknown tried to drag the monument, but something seems to have prevented them. The police found the monument at a certain distance from the installation site. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Cheilodactylus variegatus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Cheilodactylus variegatus''''', the '''Peruvian morwong''' or '''bilagai''', is a species of ray-finned fish found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean off the western coast of South America. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''C. variegatus'' can grow to a maximum length of and a maximum recorded weight of . &&&&& &&&&& Distribution &&&&& ''C. variegatus'' is endemic to the subtropical southeastern Pacific Ocean, within the area bounded by 5째S to 37째S, and 81째W to 71째W . Its range extends southwards along the coast of South America, from Paita in Peru to Talcahuano in Chile. &&&&& &&&&& Ecology &&&&& ''C. variegatus'' occurs in small schools amongst the kelp forests of ''Macrocystis integrifolia'' which grow on rocks in the shallow subtidal zone and the lower intertidal zone on the coast of Chile. &&&&& &&&&& In a survey of the inhabitants of these kelp forests, there was found to be a wide diversity of molluscs and crustaceans, with the sea urchin ''Tetrapygus niger'' and the gastropod ''Tegula tridentata'' being dominant. The most common fish was the herbivorous ''Aplodactylus punctatus''. The main carnivorous fish were the Peruvian morwong, the Chilean sandperch (''Pinguipes chilensis''), the Cape redfish (''Sebastes capensis'') and the sea chub ''Graus nigra''. &&&&& &&&&& Uses &&&&& People of the Chinchorro culture who inhabited the arid coast of Chile some 3500 BP and built their culture around fishing, had sophisticated fishing equipment and their middens show abundant remains of ''C. variegatus'', along with those of the clingfish ''Sicyases sanguineus'', the Chilean sheepshead wrasse ''Semicossyphus darwini'' and Labrisomids. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

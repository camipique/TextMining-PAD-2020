Badr al-Din Tabrizi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Badr al-Din Tabrizi''' (fl. 1250–1275) was an Iranian architect and scholar in medieval Anatolia. He is credited with the creation of the tomb of Rumi in Konya. &&&&& &&&&& In all likelihood, like other Iranian craftsmen and scholars, Bad al-Din Tabrizi had come to Anatolia in order to seek safety after the Mongol invasion of Iran in the mid thirteenth century. According to the ''Manāqeb al-ʿārefīn'', a contemporary source written by Shams al-Din Ahmad Aflaki, Badr al-Din Tabrizi also had knowledge of numerous other matters, including "astrology, mathematics, geometry, spells and magic, alchemy, philosophy, and the cultivation of citrus". Aflaki, himself a disciple of Rumi, praised Badr al-Din Tabrizi as "the second Socrates and Greek Plato". &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

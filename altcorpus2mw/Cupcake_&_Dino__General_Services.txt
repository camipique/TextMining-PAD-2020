Each episode also has repeated basic themes found in young children's programming such as friendship, honesty, bravery, and loyalty—often accompanied by simple songs emphasizing these themes. &&&&& &&&&& The show utilizes a mix of live-action and animation—the live-action sequences were recycled from Shutterstock, which the crew used with permission. &&&&& &&&&& Characters &&&&& ===Main=== &&&&& * Cupcake B.

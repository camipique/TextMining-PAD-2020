Allan Steen Kristensen &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Allan Steen Kristensen''' (1958-1997) was a Danish person who, as a 19-year-old student, placed nine pipe bombs in and around Copenhagen in 1977-1978. He was nicknamed the 'Bomberman from Gladsaxe' (''Bombemanden fra Gladsaxe'') and 'Mystical X' (''Det mystiske X''). &&&&& &&&&& Of his nine bombs, five of them detonated. Four people were injured from the blasts, including himself, but no one was killed. The streak of bombs created fear among residents, which were further bolstered by numerous phone and letter threats. &&&&& &&&&& His first bomb was in Søborg on 4 August 1977. His most spectacular location of a bomb was in a sandbox at a school in Gladsaxe on 11 November 1977, which was buried in the sand and connected to a toy, discovered by a child. The bomb was not triggered because its battery fell out of the assembly. &&&&& &&&&& At a crowded communist meeting on 1 May 1978 in Fælledparken, Kristensen accidentally exploded a bomb between his hands, losing three fingers on his right hand. He was then arrested. During his trial he claimed that he had no political motives. Doctors also claimed that he was normal and well-behaved. On 16 March 1979, Kristensen was sentenced to five years in prison. However he was probed in September 1981, later graduating as a chemist and marrying. &&&&& &&&&& Kristensen died from heart problems in 1997. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Beer from bread &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& A 330ml can of Marks & Spencer 'Earl Grey Pale Ale' (5% ABV), made using bread, flavoured with Earl Grey tea, brewed by Adnams &&&&& &&&&& Although most beer is brewed using cereal grains — most commonly malted barley — as a source of starch sugars, it can also be made from bread. &&&&& &&&&& Beers made from bread include Sahti in Finland, Kvass in Russia and Ukraine, and Bouza in Egypt and Sudan. &&&&& &&&&& In several countries, 'Toast Ale' is made — in a range of styles — from surplus bread from the catering trade, as part of a campaign to reduce food waste. The recipe is open source. Inspired by this, Adnams brewed a range of three beers exclusively for Marks & Spencer in 2018, using leftover bread from the store's sandwich suppliers. All the waste bread was then used as animal feed. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

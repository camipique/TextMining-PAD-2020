Crown of Arthain &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Crown of Arthain''''' is a 1981 video game published by Microlab. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Crown of Arthain'' is a two-player fantasy game in which the board, a hex map drawn in hi-res graphics with features such as rivers, forest, and a mountain range down the middle, is home for two princes searching for their father's crown. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& John Morrison reviewed ''Crown of Arthain'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 49. Morrison commented that "''Crown of Arthain'' would have made a fair two-player game if the monster frequency was reduced drastically. Also, the price is a tad high. As a one-player game it has nothing to recommend it. I recommend it as-is only to rich gamers who'll buy anything." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché''''' is a 2018 documentary about the first female filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché, directed by Pamela B. Green. It was screened out of competition at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival in the Cannes Classics category. It was nominated for the festival's L'Œil d'or documentary prize. &&&&& &&&&& Synopsis &&&&& &&&&& Narrated by Jodie Foster, ''Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché'' is a two-hour feature documentary investigating the full scope of the life and work of cinema's first female director, screenwriter, producer, and studio owner Alice Guy-Blaché. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& &&&&& The project was launched with a successful Kickstarter campaign, which prompted other crowdfunding opportunities. &&&&& &&&&& == Critical response == &&&&& &&&&& Reviews for the version of the film screened at Cannes were generally positive, with ''Deadline'''s Pete Hammond claiming it to be perhaps "The Best (And Least-Seen) Film in Cannes." &&&&& &&&&& However, in his review for ''Variety'', Jay Weissberg commented: "there's that title, ''The Untold Story'', which ignores a number of earlier documentaries not to mention the significant amount of scholarship on pioneering filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché. ... These are what can be called inconvenient truths, for Pamela B. Green, director of ''Be Natural'', is on a mission to discover why—supposedly—no one has ever heard of Alice Guy-Blaché." &&&&& &&&&& Reviewing for ''The Hollywood Reporter'', Leslie Felperin considered that ''Be Natural'' "represents a timely contribution to the international conversation about the challenges facing women filmmakers while also boosting the reputation of someone who really should be better known by now as a role model. As a teaching and consciousness-raising tool, it will be an indispensable resource." &&&&& &&&&& Katie Walsh for The LA times says, "Green’s film serves as an incredibly necessary tonic, reestablishing the prominent role of women at the advent of cinema, when anything was possible." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

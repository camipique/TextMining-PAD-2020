175	Col_de_Portet
Col de Portet &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Col de Portet''' is a mountain pass in the French Pyrenees in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées and the Occitanie region. The eastern side of the pass is located in the heart of the skiing area above Saint-Lary-Soulan, and is the winter home of the snowpark of the resort. In summer, it is one of the gateways to the Néouvielle massif and the Pyrénées National Park for hikers. &&&&& &&&&& Cycling &&&&& An attempt to reach the Col de Portet had already been considered by the city of Saint-Lary-Soulan for the 1982 Tour de France, after several arrivals at the Pla d'Adet ski station. Though, the planned finish was cancelled at the end of May 1982, resulting in a finish at Pla d'Adet. &&&&& &&&&& After a further wait of 36 years, the climb to the Col de Portet was introduced in the 2018 Tour de France, as the finish for Stage 17. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Souvenir Henri Desgrange &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official site &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

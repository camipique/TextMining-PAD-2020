College Capers &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The title card of ''College Capers''. &&&&& '''''College Capers''''' is a 1931 animated short film produced by The Van Beuren Corporation and was released by the film distributor Path√©. &&&&& &&&&& The film, which was directed by John Foster and Harry Bailey, features the doings of a plethora of animals at college. The name of the cartoon means that the events in the cartoon represent mischief, as the informal meaning of Caper is "an ridiculous activity". &&&&& &&&&& Released on 15 March 1931, the cartoon is part of the early sound series entitled ''Aesop's Sound Fables''. However, despite being in the series. The film is not based on an actual Aesop fable. &&&&& &&&&& However, like the other cartoons Van Beuren produced, the film has fallen into the public domain. This is because of their age, the studio's collapse, and their inclusion on budget DVD's. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& The film's closing shot: The hippo being strung from a goalpost. &&&&& The film begins with the animals travelling to college, whilst all singing a song. Once they are all in the classroom, the professor announces, through a nonsense accent, that roll-call will be taking part. The animals, through a song, explain that they are all present. He is not amused, as the professor angrily asks the students to sit down. After that, a student is caught sleeping by another pupil, who plays a song on his guitar in order to wake him up. Then, several students duplicate the song on other instruments, whilst others dance to it. This continues until the sports coach comically sucks them up in a giant vacuum cleaner, in order to transport them to the viewer podium to watch a sports game. The beginning of the game, the band plays a song, which is provided from audio recycled from ''Circus Capers.'' After the playing, the game begins, which is a group of mouses versus a hippo. At the start of the game, the first set of mouses get comically flattened by the ball, due to the hippo comically treating the ball like a rolling pin. However, some of the mouses manage to get on to his back, in order to prevent him from scoring. This does not help, as the hippo scores anyway by comically flinging himself over the bar. After the game, the medics comically pick up the injured mouses with a spatula, due to them being flattened. In the second game, the mouses bring out substitutes in order to replace the injured. When the second game starts, a group of mouses form a pyramid and ram into the hippo. This makes one of the players go over him. When the hippo realises and tries to grab him. The mouse comically goes under the court in order to escape the hippo and run to the goalpost, with the other mouses pin the hippo down. The mouse scores the point, and wins the game. This makes the audience enter the court ''en masse'' to attack the hippo. The film ends with the entire college walking down the street and celebrating, with the hippo strung up from the goal. &&&&& &&&&& Characters &&&&& In the film, the characters are the plethora of animals which attend the college. These animals come in a variety of species, from pigs, dogs and mouses. There is also the hippo, who loses the game of American football. Milton and Rita Mouse do not appear in this cartoon due to the Disney lawsuit agreement, which was to no longer use the characters. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& ''College Capers'' received positive reviews from the cinema magazines at that time. Film Daily said the film was "unusually good" and said the film had "laughable gags". Whilst the Motion Picture Herald said the film was "just fair". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

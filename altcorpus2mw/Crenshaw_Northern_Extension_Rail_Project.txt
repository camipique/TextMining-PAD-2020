Crenshaw Northern Extension Rail Project &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Crenshaw Northern Extension Rail Project''' is a planned Los Angeles Metro Rail light rail transit corridor extension connecting Expo/Crenshaw station to Hollywood/Highland station in Hollywood. The corridor is a north to south route along mostly densely populated areas of the Los Angeles Basin; it would be operated as part of the Crenshaw/LAX Line. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is prioritizing the project along with pressure from the West Hollywood residents. Construction is slated to start in 2041 and begin service by 2047 unless means to accelerate the project are found. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has $2.33 billion from Measure M. The Crenshaw/LAX Line is a light rail line that is currently under construction between the Green Line and the Expo Line. With connection to LAX. A northern extension could possibly connect with regional job centers and tourist destinations. The Cedar Sinai hospital, Beverly Center, The Grove, Farmers Market shopping area and LACMA. The West Hollywood areas are also in the projected routes, Melrose and the sunset strip within walking distance. &&&&& &&&&& The original plans for the Crenshaw Corridor project connected Wilshire Blvd to LAX. However, during environmental review, Metro determined that if LRT were selected as the preferred mode, the cost for the entire route would exceed the project budget. In December 2009, the Metro Board selected LRT as the preferred mode; as a result, the part of the corridor north of Exposition Boulevard was deferred until funds become available. This segment can be considered a "Phase 2" extension of the original line. &&&&& &&&&& Any Phase 2 extension would be expected to connect to the Purple Line, the first phase of which is currently under construction as part of the Purple Line Extension project. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2009, Metro released a report on the feasibility of an extension north to Wilshire Boulevard. It first screened two routes—one to Wilshire/La Brea, and another to Wilshire/Crenshaw. Through this screening, staff concluded that Wilshire/La Brea station would be more cost-effective and more compatible with land uses and plans along its route. Specifically, the report cited the following advantages of the La Brea route over the Crenshaw route: &&&&& &&&&& :* Greater residential and job density, &&&&& :* Supportive land-uses for a high capacity subway, &&&&& :* Stronger regional potential to link this corridor northward towards Hollywood in the future, &&&&& :* Strong community support in the Hancock Park area and &&&&& :* Fewer geotechnical soil impacts compared to the Hydrogen sulfide soil along Crenshaw Blvd north of Pico Boulevard. &&&&& &&&&& In October 2010, the Metro Board voted to eliminate the Wilshire/Crenshaw station from the Purple Line Subway Extension project, for similar reasons. &&&&& &&&&& The 3.5-mile Wilshire/La Brea route heads north on Crenshaw to Venice, west on Venice to San Vicente, continuing northwest on San Vicente to La Brea, and then north on La Brea to Wilshire. It has three possible stations: Crenshaw/Adams (optional), Pico/San Vicente, and Wilshire/La Brea. &&&&&  &&&&& The feasibility report also allowed for two possible branches/extensions along La Brea Ave, Fairfax Ave, La Cienega Blvd or San Vicente Blvd heading north of Wilshire into West Hollywood and/or Hollywood. &&&&& &&&&& In November 2010, Metro staff produced an initial review of the feasibility of studying a new transit corridor to connect the Crenshaw Corridor to West Hollywood and/or Hollywood. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2014, the West Hollywood City Council considered a proposal by Council members John Heilman and Jeffrey Prang to engage a lobbyist to promote the need for Metro rail services in West Hollywood. The Heilman/Prang proposal notes that "former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa assured West Hollywood representatives that West Hollywood would be 'next in line'." In 2015, the West Hollywood City Council launched the West Hollywood Advocates for Metro Rail (WHAM) as part of a campaign to win grassroots support for a Metro rail extension into the city. &&&&& &&&&& In September 2016, in a letter to West Hollywood City Council member Lindsey Horvath, Metro CEO Phil Washington outlined several steps Metro is taking to make the Crenshaw/LAX northern extension "shovel ready" should county voters approve Measure M, a countywide ballot measure adding new transit projects and expediting others previously approved under Measure R. &&&&& &&&&& ===Connection to Phase 1=== &&&&& &&&&& The final design of "Phase 1" (the original project line south of Exposition Blvd to LAX) would determine how the Phase 2 project could or would connect to Phase 1. The original locally preferred alternative (LPA) for the Crenshaw/LAX Line from the draft environmental impact study (Draft EIS/EIR) specified an at-grade station at the Phase 1 Expo/Crenshaw terminus, with the Leimert Park tunnel ending several blocks south of that, near 39th Street. If Phase 1 was built per the LPA, then Phase 2 would require the building of a new tunnel with a connection near 39th Street. This would require the north end of the Leimert Park tunnel to be outfitted with knockout panels to allow for the possible future extension north. &&&&& &&&&& Metro also studied "Design Option 6" for Phase 1, which would extend the Leimert Park tunnel north to the line's northern terminus at Exposition, with an underground station at Crenshaw/Exposition. This design option was selected so that Phase 2 can connect to Phase 1 directly at the Crenshaw/Exposition station's tunnels. This design option increased the cost of the original Phase 1 project by $236 million. &&&&& &&&&& Proposed routes &&&&& In July 2018, Metro released its initial set of rail concepts and rail alternatives for the corridor. Conducted by AECOM. &&&&& &&&&& ===Initial alternatives analysis=== &&&&& The July 2018 concepts released by Metro included five alternative plans to be considered. These included different alignments, but the same mode, light rail as the Crenshaw corridor phase one is currently under construction as light rail. The alternatives considered are all north to south routes: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& DEIR Alternative &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& &&&&& New trips(daily) &&&&& &&&&& Estimated cost(billions) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''1: San Vicente Alternative''' &&&&& &&&&& Continuing north underground from Expo/Crenshaw station, veer northwest on San Vicente Boulevard and rises to aerial and at-grade along the center median at various points.

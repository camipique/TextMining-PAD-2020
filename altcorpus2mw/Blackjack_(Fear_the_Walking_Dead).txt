Luciana comes across Clayton, an older man who is mortally wounded and trapped in his car from the storm. His last wish is to have a beer, so Luciana sets off in search of one. John and Strand assemble a raft using a camper shell from a truck. John uses the horn to lure Infected to the water to distract the alligator as they begin to cross. However, the horn dies and the alligator attacks their raft, causing a leak. John fires at it and they swim back. Luciana discovers a supply box left by Morgan and finds a beer inside (from Jim, who is a brewer). The box is also marked with Morgan's radio channel. Luciana returns to Clayton with the beer, and he tells her he was a truck driver and has notebooks with descriptions of locations where he left supplies. He later dies. Luciana reunites with Morgan and the others after contacting his radio channel.

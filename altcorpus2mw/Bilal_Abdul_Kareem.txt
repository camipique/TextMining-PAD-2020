Bilal Abdul Kareem &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Bilal Abdul Kareem''' (born '''Darrell Lamont Phelps''') is an American journalist covering the Syrian Civil War. He has worked with CNN, and produces the YouTube channel "On the Ground News". He believes that he has been placed on the U.S. Kill List. &&&&& He reportedly survived five drone assassination attempts by the US military, which killed random civilians that were present nearby, including two attacks on vehicles he was travelling in. Including the one where the car he was sitting in was blown up by a missile. &&&&& &&&&& He has been criticised by some observers for a perceived alignment to jihadi fighters in Syria, with the New York Times reporting that Kareem was considered a "Jihadist propagandist" to some. His perceived alignment to jihadi fighters in Syria led Russia Today to criticise his reported "praise" of certain Islamic militants opposed to the Syrian government. &&&&& &&&&& In 2018, he sued the United States government, claiming they had attempted to assassinate him, and requesting his removal from the Disposition Matrix. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * OGN News &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

187	Aletia_argentaria
Aletia argentaria &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Aletia argentaria''''' is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and can be found in Southland. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& The species was first described by George Howes in 1945 using a specimen collected by him at the Wilderness near Lake Te Anau. The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the ''Aletia'' genus is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. It is likely that this species will be removed from the genus ''Aletia'' and be placed within one of the following genera: ''Physetica'', ''Graphania'', ''Tmetolophota'' or ''Ichneutica''. As such the species is currently also known as ''Aletia'' (''s.l.'') ''cuneata''. The holotype specimen is held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& &&&&& This species was described by Howes as follows:  &&&&& This species was regarded by George Hudson as being very similar to ''Aletia panda'', differing only in having narrower forewings, more oblique termen and smaller orbicular stigma. &&&&& &&&&& Distribution &&&&& This species is endemic to New Zealand. It inhabits Southland. Hudson regarded this species as being "extremely obscure". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Image of holotype specimen &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

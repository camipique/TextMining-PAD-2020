Battle of Walla Walla &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Battle of Walla Walla''' was the longest battle fought during the Yakima War. The battle began on December 7, 1855 and ended on December 11th, 1855. The battle was fought between six companies of the Oregon Mounted Volunteers and the Walla Walla. Fighting alongside the Walla Walla were members of several different tribes, such as the Cayuse, Palouse and Yakama. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Following a Walla Walla raid on the Fort Walla Walla trading post and reports that Chief Peopeomoxmox had vowed to kill Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens, troops from the Oregon Mounted Volunteers were dispatched to the Umatilla River and later to the Touchet River. &&&&& &&&&& The Chief and four others met the troops at the Touchet and became their hostage in order to prevent an attack on his village. The volunteers and the five hostages began to march down the Touchet in order to establish a winter camp. &&&&& &&&&& Battle &&&&& As the soldiers marched towards the former Whitman Mission, they realized that they were being pursued by a large group of Native warriors. Soon, a running battle began at the mouth of the Touchet. On the first day, four of the five hostages, including the chief, were killed by volunteers in a struggle to escape their captors. &&&&& &&&&& On the fourth and final day of the battle, Both the Natives and the Volunteers withdrew, the Volunteers to Fort Henrietta on the Umatilla. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& The battle resulted in the death of Walla Walla tribe leader, Peo-Peo-Mox-Mox along with the deaths of six volunteers and between 75 and 100 Natives. The total Native casualties are unknown due to bodies being taken from the battlefield, but volunteers did find 39 bodies following the battle. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

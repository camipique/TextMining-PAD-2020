Afterpay &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Afterpay Touch Group Limited''' (abbreviated as '''Afterpay''' or '''APT''') is an Australian financial technology company operating in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Afterpay and Touchcorp merged in June 2017 to form Afterpay Touch Group. Since the merger, Afterpay Touch Group has emerged as a leader in the "buy now pay later" industry. &&&&& &&&&& Business &&&&& &&&&& Subsequent to the merger, Afterpay's business operations consist of "pay now" and "pay later" business segments. Its pay later business enables retailers to offer their customers the facility to buy now and pay later without requiring traditional credit, upfront fees or interest allowing customers to have the ability to make purchases now and pay for them in four equal payments made every fortnight without any interest. There is no interest charged to customers for using this service. However, failure to make their payments will result in a late fee. Customers are required to be over eighteen years of age to use the service. &&&&& &&&&& The pay now business consists of the Touch System Platform, which includes services related to fraud protection, regulatory compliance, and data collection and analysis for digital payments. &&&&& &&&&& Expansion &&&&& In January 2018, US venture capital fund Matrix Partners announced its intention to invest $AU19.4 million in Afterpay to support its entry into the US retail market, which was worth $US3.8 trillion in total annual turnover, including $US450 billion in online purchases. Afterpay launched in the US in mid-May 2018 with retailers such as Urban Outfitters, with over US$11m of underlying sales was processed in the first full month in June 2018. &&&&& &&&&& In August 2018, Afterpay entered into a share purchase agreement to purchase Clearpay, a UK based buy now pay later subsidiary of Thinksmart. Under the Agreement, Afterpay acquired 90% of the equity in ClearPay for total consideration of 1 million Afterpay shares. Afterpay has the option to purchase the remaining 10% in any time 5 years subsequent to the purchase. Afterpay aims to launch in the UK in the second half of 2019. &&&&& &&&&& Criticism and regulation &&&&& Some news outlets have ousted Afterpay as a scheme, one stating that is putting vulnerable young women into vicious cycles of debt that follow them long after they stop spending. &&&&& &&&&& Additionally, market commentators suggest whilst buy now pay later payment options (such as Afterpay and its competitors) are showing significant upside for Australian retail sales, they may be unable to sustain such growth they continue to show they are able to generate larger basket sizes (i.e., extra sales that consumers would not otherwise have made). &&&&& &&&&& A report from ASIC revealed that Afterpay earned 24.4% of its income from late fees â€” and 75.6% from merchant fees. Critics have argued that the service may cause financial stress and the accumulation of debt. Despite this, 95% of payments have not received a late fee. &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& The company was named FinTech Organisation of the Year for two years in a row in 2017 and 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Competition &&&&& Afterpay has a number of competitors including Zippay, Klarna, Splitit and Sezzle. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Antennatus coccineus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''scarlet frogfish''', ''Antennatus coccineus'', is a fish of the family Antennariidae, found in the waters of the Indo-Pacific (except Hawaii). It grows to in total length. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Antennatus coccineus'' has a head and body usually mottled red or yellowish to reddish brown, with few small dark blotches. The median and pelvic fins have dark brown to black spots. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& Pietsch and Grobecker (1987) synonymized ''Antennatus drombus'' from the Hawaiian Islands with ''A. coccineus'', but Williams (1989) recognized it as distinct, as did Randall (1996, 2007, 2010). ''A. coccineus'' is distinct from ''A. drombus'' in the number of pectoral rays, in having a white esca, and the paucity of small dark blotches on the body and fins. &&&&& &&&&& ''A. coccineus'' was previously classified in ''Antennarius'', but in 2012 was re-assigned to ''Antennatus'' based on DNA-based analysis. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

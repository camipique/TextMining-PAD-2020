AHSTW Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''AHSTW Community School District''' is a school district headquartered in Avoca, Iowa. &&&&& &&&&& The district serves sections of Cass, Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Shelby counties. It serves Avoca, Hancock, Shelby, Walnut, and much of Tennant. The initials of the five cities form the name of the school district. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& It was formed by the merger of the A-H-S-T Community School District and the Walnut Community School District on July 1, 2016. The initial school board was to be simply a combination of the existing A-H-S-T and Walnut districts, with a total of seven members: two from Walnut and the remainder from A-H-S-T. The prospective future board would have seven members, with two at-large and the remainder based on voting districts. The proportion was set since the former Walnut district had about one-fourth of the population of the combined AHSTW district. &&&&& &&&&& School building &&&&& &&&&& Circa 2015 the middle school area of the AHSTW Secondary School building in Avoca was scheduled to receive an expansion. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * AHSTW Community School District &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

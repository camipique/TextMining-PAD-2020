Constitutional Revolution's Associations &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''associations of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution''' (), are a number of political and state communities that not only were the official initiators of the civil society participation in Iran but, also played a key role in the victory of the Constitutional Revolution and the formation of subsequent parties. &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& At the end of the Naser al-Din Shah Qajar period and in the early days of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's rule, a number of intellectuals and a group of government agents associated with the European countries, who considered Iran's political and social outcomes in the absence of law and respect for individual freedoms, gradually began to rumor and talk about reforms. &&&&&  &&&&& The reform was based on three amendments of law, civil law, reforming the court system, and preventing foreign intervention. &&&&& Primary core &&&&& Perhaps we can recognize Sayyid Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī as one of the forerunners of the popular reformist campaigns. Although his efforts were mostly to keep the rulers awake, his thoughts in founding the associations were not affected. &&&&& &&&&& Mirza Malkam Khan Nazem Al- Doleh was known as the founder of the first core of the associations by establishing Faramoosh Khaneh and then forming the Adamiat Association (called the Hizbullah Group). &&&&& &&&&& So, in during the Reji Agreement and the tobacco boycott we are witnessing a popular upsurge and the formation of the first cores of the associations. The Tobacco Protest Contract is one of the reasons to bring and gather the people and also helps to the formation of organizations. &&&&& &&&&& Type of activity &&&&& &&&&& The associations during the Constitutional Revolution were divided into political, state, religious, literary, and regional according to their statute. But the developments in the country were such that almost all of them were active in pursuit of political and social demands. Some of the associations had secret activities before the constitutional victory, but, their activities, statutes, and members' names were not mentioned publicly.  &&&&& &&&&& Political associations &&&&& &&&&& At the time of the incident in the Toopkhaneh Square, and before the artillery of the parliament, more than 48 associations were active in Tehran.  &&&&& &&&&& The number of state and political associations in the country reached to more than 100 associations, and state associations also intervened in political and social activities. &&&&& &&&&& Agree to constitutionalism &&&&& &&&&& ===The secret association=== &&&&& The secret association was founded in the year 1904 by Mirza Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai. His goal was to promote the people and familiarize them with political rights. Gradually, some rapid methods were adopted and made some of the members to withdrawal from the association. &&&&& &&&&& The members were called and known as "Fada'i". They joined together to bring justice for the courthouse and the parliament. Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai, Nazem al-salam Kermani, Mirza Agha Isfahani, and Majd al-Islam Kermani were the members of the association. &&&&& &&&&& ===The association of Baghe Mekideh=== &&&&& &&&&& The Baghe Mekideh Association was secretly established in Muharram 1322 by some libertarians and reformists.

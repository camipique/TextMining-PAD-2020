Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar (video game) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar''''' is a video game developed by French studio Tek 5 and published by Cryo Interactive, which was released for the PlayStation and the PC. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& ''Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar'' is an action video game based on the film ''Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar''. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& According to French newspaper ''Les Échos'', Cryo's ''Asterix & Obelix'' game was a commercial hit, with sales of 200,000 units on the PlayStation by December 1999. By April 2000, this number had risen to 300,000 units. &&&&& &&&&& GameGuru stated that "You're suppose to have reflexes to catch some mostly flying objects (like fish or baked pigs) and do something with them like bring them to the first free table. Very simple, and very boring." &&&&& &&&&& Hardcore Gaming 101 said " imagine a whole game completely based on running and fetching objects. That is Astérix & Obélix Take On Caesar. Yes in this game you rarely even meet the Romans at all, you spend your time serving wild boars to village people (not the band, even though these guys dress quite similar) or fetching misteltoes from trees. It's an absolutely baffling choice of gameplay, one that grows old pretty quickly and never starts being fun to begin with." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

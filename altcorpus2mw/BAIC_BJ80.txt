The patent for the vehicle was revealed on February 15, 2012. &&&&& &&&&& At the time, the BJ80VJ's engines were taken from Nissan-made 2.0/2.2 engines. These were made with manual-only transmissions. &&&&& &&&&& In December 30, 2013, there were rumors that the BJ80 could have a Saab-based 2.0 turbo engine. It was later confirmed that it would a Saab 2.3 turbo petrol engine. &&&&& &&&&& In April 2014, the BJ80 production vehicle was unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show with a 2.4-liter petrol engine and 5-speed manual transmission. The use of the 2.8-liter engine instead of the 3.2-liter diesel engine was finalized by BAIC, but the former would be used for PLA vehicles. During the show, BAIC representatives claimed that the display vehicle was using a 4.0 V8 engine with an automatic transmission system in place. &&&&& &&&&& The BJ80C vehicle was unveiled at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show. A BJ80C Safari vehicle was also unveiled in the show. &&&&& &&&&& Military variants of the SUV are equipped with a Cummins 2.8 liter four-cylinder diesel engine, having a max output on 160hp and 360nm. &&&&& &&&&& On December 26, 2016, BAIC released a luxury version of the BJ80 with new front and rear bumpers, new alloys, red brakes, a new bonnet with an air scoop and two individual rear seats instead of the 3-seat bench . &&&&& &&&&& Military versions of the BJ80 have been equipped with BeiDou Navigation Satellite System as a standard feature. &&&&& &&&&& Specifications &&&&& The BJ80 is currently marketed with either 2.8-liter turbodiesel with 163 HP and a 6-speed manual gearbox or a gasoline engine 2.3 T (250 HP) with either a manual or automatic transmission, both 6-speed.

A ZF automatic gearbox is fitted, coupled to a two-speed transfer case with selectable four-wheel drive. &&&&& &&&&& Controversy &&&&& The BJ80 is a contention of controversy since it looks like the G-Class Wagon by Mercedes Benz, which was pointed out by Mercedes-Benz spokesperson Toby Mueller via Instagram. &&&&& &&&&& In 2015, rumors were abound that Daimler were not pleased with BAIC copying the look of the G-Class Wagon with plans to force the company to kill the marketing of the vehicle. &&&&& &&&&& While the G-Wagon has influenced it, aspect of the vehicle was also based on Beijing Qishi S12, a Beijing-made Jeep Cherokee. &&&&& &&&&& In 2018, the BJ80 was put in a test against the G-Wagon in Yongding, Anhui Province under PLA supervision. Critics have accused the PLA of conducting the tests in favor of the BJ80 due to them supervising and evaluating the two SUVs since Mercedes has more experience and history in manufacturing and marketing the G-Wagon. &&&&& &&&&& Variants &&&&& * BJ80C: Old name for the BJ80 (C meaning civilian), now defunct. &&&&& * BJ80D: BJ80 with a diesel-only engine. &&&&& * BJ80V: Concept SUV for civilian use, now defunct for the BJ80C name. &&&&& * BJ80VJ: Concept SUV for the People's Liberation Army with Nissan 2.0/2.2 engines. &&&&& * BJ80J: The basic military version of the BJ80.

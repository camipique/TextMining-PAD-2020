After the Ottomans withdrew from Qatar, the building became the official office of Qatar's Rulers, and was renamed Doha Palace, also sometimes being known as Qal'at Al-Shouyoukh (Palace of the Sheikhs). The fort was officially renamed to Amiri Diwan in 1971 after Qatar gained its independence from the United Kingdom and the title Amir replaced the title Ruler of the State of Qatar. &&&&& &&&&& Activities &&&&& Among the duties of the Amiri Diwan are: &&&&& *Updating the Amir of Qatar on the latest international and domestic developments; &&&&& *Presenting draft laws to the Amir for approval; &&&&& *Relaying instructions from the Amir to other governmental bodies. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Old Amiri Palace, Doha &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Abigail Solomon-Godeau &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Abigail Solomon-Godeau''' (born January 6, 1948, in New York City, New York, U.S.A.) is an American art critic, exhibition curator and art historian. &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& B.A. magna cum laude, University of Massachusetts &&&&& &&&&& Ph.D. Graduate Center, City University of New York &&&&& &&&&& Life and work &&&&& Abigail Solomon-Godeau is an art critic and art historian who taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and is now a Professor Emeritus there in the Department of History of Art & Architecture. &&&&& &&&&& Solomon-Godeau has produced over one hundred works in 236 publications in 4 languages. Her writing focuses on feminist theory, photography, 19th century French art and contemporary art, and she offers a reassessment or revision of the ideas presented by the artistic 'canon' and of some of her predecessors in the history of art, such as Martha Rosler and Susan Sontag. In a 2004 essay she describes herself as among those who "intellectually came of age as postmodernists, poststructuralists, feminists, Marxists, antihumanists, or, for that matter, atheists." and later clarifies; &&&&& :I do not consider my work to be particularly theoretical, although my writings on photography, like those on art history or contemporary art, are informed by the theorists, past and present, who have shaped my thinking overall. Perhaps my essays are best characterized as a form of practical criticism insofar as they engage with specific bodies of work, historical contexts, social relations, and institutional structures, rather than with the more philosophical questions manifested in the new field of the philosophy of photography. &&&&& &&&&& Her essays have appeared in journals including ''Art in America'', ''Artforum'', ''The Art Journal'', ''Afterimage'', ''Camera Obscura'', ''October'', ''Screen'', and many have been collected in anthologies in various languages. &&&&& &&&&& She is currently working on a book ''Genre, Gender and the Nude in French Art''. &&&&& &&&&& Exhibition curator &&&&& Among the exhibitions Solomon-Godeau has curated are; &&&&& *''The Way We Live Now'', 1982 &&&&& *''Sexual Difference: Both Sides of the Camera'', 1992 &&&&& *''Mistaken Identities'' (with Constance Lewallen), 1994 &&&&& *''The Image of Desire; Femininity, Modernity, and the Birth of Mass Culture in Nineteenth-Century France'' (with Beatrice Farwell), 1998. &&&&& &&&&& Publications &&&&& &&&&& === Books === &&&&& &&&&& *''Photography at the Dock.

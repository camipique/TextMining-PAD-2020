The seven other Republics or cities were Rajagriha, Vaishali, Kapilavastu, Ramagrama, Pava, Kushinagar, and Vethapida. &&&&& &&&&& The people of Allakappa were called the Bulayas or Bulis. They were located somewhere in Bihar, in the historical area of the Buddha, but they are mentioned only in the Digha Nikaya. &&&&& &&&&& Once received by the Bulis, the relics were stored inside a stupa. &&&&& &&&&& The Bulis of Allakappa received a portion of the Buddha's relics following the ''War over the Buddha's Relics'' against the Sakyas.

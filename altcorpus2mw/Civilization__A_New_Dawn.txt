Civilization: A New Dawn &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Sid Meier's Civilization: A New Dawn''''' is a 2017 strategy board game created by James Kniffen based on the ''Civilization'' series of video games. It is primarily inspired by the series' 2016 iteration, ''Civilization VI''. Each player takes the role of a historical civilization, competing with other players with the goal of fulfilling various historically-inspired victory conditions in order to win the game. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Some reviews praised ''A New Dawn'''s new features, many of which simplified the game compared to its 2010 predecessor, ''Civilization: The Board Game''. ''Deseret News'' praised the addition of "focus cards" particularly and called the game "engrossing," noting that it "doesn't have all the bells and whistles of its older brother, but it has its own secret sauce, an original new mechanism that streamlines play while keeping things detailed and interesting." Some reviews argued that the game might be "too streamlined." Luke Plunkett of ''Kotaku.com'' compared it unfavorably with the computer-game version, writing, "It reaches too far, and by cutting straight to the heart of ''Civilization''â€™s video game design, forgets everything else that makes ''Civ'' so much fun on a computer." The game has an overall rating of 7.5 on the website ''BoardGameGeek.com''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& ''Civilization: A New Dawn'' Official Website.

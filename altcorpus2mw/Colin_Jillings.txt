Colin Jillings &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Colin Jillings''' (born in Auckland 11 March 1931) was a leading trainer in thoroughbred horse racing in New Zealand from the early 1950's through until his retirement in September 2005. Prior to that he was a successful apprentice jockey before increasing weight brought a premature end to a promising career. &&&&& &&&&& An "Ellerslie boy", Colin Jillings became an apprentice jockey at the age of 12 (1943). He would catch the train to school St Peter's College, Auckland each day after earlier riding trackwork at the Ellerslie Racecourse. . His biggest success as an apprentice was the 1946 Railway Handicap (a race he would later win 3 times as a trainer: Pipe Dream(1962); Sharivari(1971) and Diamond Lover(1987) aboard Royal Scot. &&&&& &&&&& He trained the first of 4 Auckland Cup winners in 1956 Yemen, followed by Stipulate (1963), Perhaps (1976) and Irish Chance (in partnership with Richard Yuill) in 1999. He also achieved the unique record of training a Derby winner in each of the last 5 decades of the 20th Century: his first Derby winner being Lawful (1958) followed by Stipulate (1960), Uncle Remus (1977), I'm Henry (1983) and The Phantom Chance (1992). &&&&& &&&&& Jillings biggest success came when he trained The Phantom Chance to win the 1993 W.S. Cox Plate. Although operating with a smaller team, than most other trainers, Jillings managed to keep producing top horses year after year.. In addition to those already mentioned, other notable horses, amongst his many GP1 winners, included: Beauzami (NZ Cup); Gay Filou (Wtgn Cup); Athenia (NZ Oaks for his good friend T.J. (Tommy) Smith); Sugaratariat and Old Son (both won the Ellerslie Sires Produce Stakes for himself, and another good friend, Pukekohe market gardener, Pabu Daya); Tycoon Lil et al. &&&&& &&&&& Less well known was the fact that, in his earlier years from limited runners, he was also a noted trainer of jumpers, winning 1959 Grand National Hurdles with Armed (owned by himself); the 1971 Great Northen Hurdles/Steeples double, and 1972 Great Northern Steeples, with Brockton (for great friend, Wellington businessman, Doug Tse) and the 1987 Great Northern Steeples with Deductable, in partnership with Richard Yuill (with both sharing the ownership). &&&&& &&&&& When he retired he had amassed a total of 1327 NZ winners, 703 of those with long time training partner Richard Yuill.. &&&&& &&&&& When asked to name the best horse he ever trained Jillings had no hesitation in labelling Stipulate, the champion stayer of his era in the early 1960's. &&&&& &&&&& Jillings was inducted into the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame in 2008. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

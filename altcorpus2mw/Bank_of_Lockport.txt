Bank of Lockport &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bank of Lockport''', also known as the '''Gouaux Building''', is a historic commercial building located at 111-113 Barataria Street in Lockport, Louisiana. &&&&& &&&&& Built in 1901 in Romanesque Revival style, the masonry building was originally constructed as a one-story structure, and was expanded with the addition of a second story, in the same style, in 1910.

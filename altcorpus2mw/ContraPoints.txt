ContraPoints &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Natalie Wynn''' (born October 21, 1988) is an American YouTuber of comedic and educational videos about politics, gender, race, and philosophy on her channel '''ContraPoints'''. Wynn's videos are noted for their use of sets and costumes, and their ironic humor. She has been noted for her influence in the left wing YouTube video essay sub-genre. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Wynn was born in Arlington, Virginia and became a philosophy graduate student and instructor at Northwestern University in the state of Illinois. Wynn commenced a PhD program but dropped out 2015. She has written fiction, taught piano, and worked as a paralegal and copywriter. &&&&& &&&&& YouTube career &&&&& Wynn started creating videos on YouTube in 2008, initially publishing videos about atheism. In 2016, she began the ContraPoints YouTube channel in reaction to the Gamergate controversy and the expansion in prevalence of right-wing YouTubers, shifting her content to countering their arguments. Wynn's early videos covered subjects such as race, racism, and online radicalisation. Wynn is considered a socialist and feminist. She uses philosophy, sociology, and personal experience in her videos to explain and criticize common alt-right, fascist, classical liberal, and conservative talking points, and to explain left wing ideas. Wynn has also criticized what she sees as some left-leaning tendencies to present arguments that are "a logical success but a persuasive failure." She often illustrates arguments with her experiences as a transgender person. &&&&& &&&&& Wynn's videos often have a combative but humorous tone, containing dark or surreal humor, sarcasm, and sexual themes. Wynn often illustrates concepts by playing different characters in elaborate costumes, who engage in heated debate. The videos showcase Wynn's directorial choices, Todd Van Der Werff writing in ''Slate'' describing the "complicated lighting schemes, elaborate costumes, and genuine thought put into aesthetics you don't get in a lot of television, much less a lot of YouTube." In a 2018 interview for ''The Verge'', Katherine Cross notes a significant difference between Wynn and her internet character, explaining that the ContraPoints character is "blithe, aloof, decadent and disdainful", while Wynn "can be earnest—and she cares deeply, almost too much." &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Wynn's videos have been praised for their clarity, nuance, and attention-grabbing sense of humor. Jake Hall, writing for ''Vice'', called Wynn "one of the most incisive and compelling video essayists on YouTube". In an article contrasting her personal sincerity and her ironic sense of humor, ''The Verge'' describes her as the "Oscar Wilde of YouTube." ''New York'' magazine states, "ContraPoints is very good. Regardless of the viewer’s interest or lack thereof in internet culture wars, YouTube Nazis, or any of the other wide-ranging subjects covered in its videos, they’re funny, bizarre, erudite, and compelling." &&&&& &&&&& Nathan Robinson of ''Current Affairs'' calls ContraPoints a "one-woman blitzkrieg against the YouTube right," describing her videos as "unlike anything I've ever seen ... She shows how debate should be done: not by giving an inch to poisonous ideas, but by bringing superior smarts, funnier jokes, and more elegant costumes to the fight." Robinson also notes that because of the channel's humor and its direct attention to online culture, it seems uniquely suited to a millennial audience; Wynn's analysis of fascists' use of memes and coded symbols has been cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center in an article explaining the right-wing use of the OK sign. Journalist Liza Featherstone recommends the channel as well, saying that Wynn does a "fabulous job" acknowledging her opponents' valid points while debunking weak arguments and revealing the influence of a sometimes-unacknowledged far-right political agenda. &&&&& &&&&& In November 2018, after a ContraPoints video about incels reached over one million views, ''The New Yorker'' released a profile of the channel, describing Wynn as "one of the few Internet demi-celebrities who is as clever as she thinks she is, and one of the few leftists anywhere who can be nuanced without being boring." VanDerWerff praised Wynn's videos as "frequently, beautiful" and suggested that Wynn was uniquely suited to YouTube as a content platform. ''The Atlantic'' praised Wynn's use of "lush sets, moody lighting, and original music by the composer Zoë Blade" and opined of her videos that "The most spectacular attraction ... is Wynn herself." ''Polygon'' named her video on incels one of the ten best video essays of the year 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Wynn is a transgender woman, a matter that features heavily in her videos. She began transitioning in July 2017. Wynn previously identified as genderqueer. In her 2019 video "Are Traps Gay?", Wynn identified her sexuality as queer and polyamorous. She currently resides in Baltimore, Maryland. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Hbomberguy &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

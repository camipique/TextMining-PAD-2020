Caroline Rose &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Caroline Elizabeth Rose''' (born 1990) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. After releasing two records of folk and country-inspired music, she signed to New West Records and released a critically acclaimed pop-rock album, ''Loner''. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Born in 1990 in Long Island, Rose grew up in Center Moriches, New York. The daughter of two artists, Rose began writing songs and poems at age 13. Rose attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. &&&&& &&&&& In 2012, a 22-year-old Caroline Rose and producer/multi-instrumentalist Jer Coons launched a Kickstarter to fund the production of a Rose's first album, ''America Religious''. The campaign exceeded its goal of $8000, eventually raising $10,115. The album, blending American folk music, country, and rockabilly styles was self-published later that year. Two years later, Rose released her first nationally distributed album, ''I Will Not Be Afraid'' on Little Hi! Records. Like the first album, it was produced with Jer Coons and featured music in a variety of Americana musical styles, including two songs previously released on ''America Religious''. &&&&& &&&&& Frustrated with the limitations of genre convention, Rose began to work on a set of new material that would broaden her sound, a process that would involve three years of writing and recording, and multiple personnel changes before publicly releasing new material. The change in musical direction also meant finding a new label to publish her work, eventually signing with New West Records. The new album, ''Loner'', was co-produced by Rose and Paul Butler, and represented a radical shift away from the musical style of her previous work, blending pop and alternative rock elements, and incorporating prominent synthesizers throughout. Notably, this album also saw a change in lyrical tone, incorporating a number of overtly humorous, sarcastic, and satirical songs. Although Rose played most of the instruments on the album, she formed a new band to perform on tour. &&&&& &&&&& Discography &&&&& ===Studio Albums=== &&&&& *''America Religious'' (2012) &&&&& *''I Will Not Be Afraid'' (2014) &&&&& *''Loner'' (2018) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

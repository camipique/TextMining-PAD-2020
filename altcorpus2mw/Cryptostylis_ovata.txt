Cryptostylis ovata &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Cryptostylis ovata''''', commonly known as the '''slipper orchid''' or '''western tongue orchid''', is an orchid endemic to Western Australia. It is a common, summer flowering species with dark green leaves with a white central vein and up to fifteen pale greenish flowers with a brownish red labellum with a network of darker veins. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Cryptostylis ovata'' is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which usually grows in colonies although only a few plants may flower in any one year. It has one to several egg-shaped leaves long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are dark green with a central white vein on the upper surface and purplish red below. This species is the only orchid in Western Australia to have leaves throughout the year. Between four and fifteen flowers long and wide are borne on a flower stem high. The sepals and petals are greenish yellow, the sepals long and wide and the petals shorter and narrower. The most prominent feature of the flower is its labellum which is long, wide when flattened, projects stiffly forwards and is reddish brown with a fine network of darker veins. Flowering occurs from November to February. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy and naming &&&&& ''Cryptostylis ovata'' was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in ''Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen''. The specific epithet (''ovata'') is a Latin word meaning "egg-shaped", referring to the shape of the leaves. &&&&& &&&&& Distribution and habitat &&&&& The slipper orchid is widespread and common in a wide range of habitats from coastal scrub to high rainfall forests. It is mainly found between Perth and Albany but sometimes further east, in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

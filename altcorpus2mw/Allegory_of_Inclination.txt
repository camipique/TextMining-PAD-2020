Allegory of Inclination &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Allegory of Inclination''''' is a 1615–1616 oil on canvas painting by Artemisia Gentileschi, now in the paintings gallery at the Casa Buonarroti in Florence. &&&&& &&&&& It was commissioned by Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger (1568–1646), nephew of Michelangelo. It shows a nude young woman with an elaborate hairstyle, representing 'Inclination', in the sense of a natural talent for something. She holds a compass in both hands, whilst a star is shown above her in the top right. Her features recur elsewhere in Gentileschi's work, such as the engraving by Jérome David, and in self-portraits of the artist. The figure's nudity later proved so embarrassing to the commissioner's great-nephew Leonardo di Buonarroto that he commissioned Baldassarre Franceschini, known as ''el Volterrano'' to paint clothes over parts of it in 1684. &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Casa Buonarroti &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

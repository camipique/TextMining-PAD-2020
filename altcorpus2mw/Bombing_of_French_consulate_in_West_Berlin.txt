Bombing of French consulate in West Berlin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''1983 French consulate bombing''' was a terrorist bomb attack targeting the Maison de France consulate on the Kurfuerstendamm in West Berlin, West Germany on 25 August 1983. It killed one person and injured 23 other people. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) claimed responsibility in a telephone call which included a bomb at a French base in Beirut the same day, and coming a month after the group's Orly Airport attack. The group commented "We will continue our struggle until the liberation of innocent Armenians from French jails." However the attack was actually orchestrated by Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal, who had relations with the ASALA's leadership. Carlos claimed responsibility in a letter written to the German Embassy in Saudi Arabia. &&&&& &&&&& The bomb, containing 20 to 30 kg of explosives of nitropenta, was planted in a storage room on the building's fourth floor by Ahmed Mustafa El-Sibai, a Lebanese man and associate of Carlos. The blast tore the building's roof, destroyed the fourth floor and caused part of it to collapse, causing a total of 2.5 million marks in damage. The explosives were brought into East Berlin by Johannes Weinrich, another close aide to Carlos, and were kept by the Stasi secret police. East German lieutenant colonel Helmut Voigt passed the explosives from Stasi's arms store to Weinrich at the Syrian Embassy, which was Carlos's base in East Germany. Weinrich successfully transported the explosives from East to West Berlin via the Friedrichstraße before giving them to El-Sibai who planted it. &&&&& &&&&& The fatal victim was 26-year-old Michael Haritz, a peace activist who was handing out leaflets at the consulate protesting France's nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific, and died from asphyxiation. &&&&& &&&&& Carlos previously bombed several targets in France, such as the 1982 Capitole train bombing. He claimed the attacks in France and West Berlin were in revenge for French air strikes against a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine training camp in Lebanon. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath and convictions &&&&& The Maison de France is a French cultural centre featuring a French book shop, grocery store, cinema and restaurant. It was rebuilt after the attack and opened by Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand in 1985. &&&&& &&&&& On 12 April 1994, Voigt was found guilty for his role in the bombing after being extradited from Greece, where he escaped to in 1991. He was sentenced to four years in prison. In 2000, Weinrich and Nabil Shritah, the Syrian diplomat who stored the explosives at the embassy, were jailed for life and for two years, respectively. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Adelaide Cottage &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Adelaide Cottage, painting by Caleb Robert Stanley (1839) &&&&& '''Adelaide Cottage''' (formerly, Adelaide Lodge) is a historic house in Windsor Home Park just east of Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. Incorporating parts of John Nash's Royal Lodge from Windsor Great Park, it was re-erected in 1831, in the picturesque style for Queen Adelaide. Architect Jeffry Wyatville oversaw the construction. When it was first built, the house was described as "chastely elegant" and having two rooms, in addition to a retiring room for the Queen, and a pages' room, as well as furnishings from the former royal lodge and a marble fireplace mantel in the regency Graeco-Egyptian style. The ceiling of its principal bedroom reuses decorative elements, including gilt dolphins and ropes, from the former royal yacht, HMY ''Royal George''. It is listed Grade II* by Historic England &&&&& and located between Adelaide Road and Queen Victoria's Walk. &&&&& &&&&& Reference &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

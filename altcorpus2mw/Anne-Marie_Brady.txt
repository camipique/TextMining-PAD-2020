Brady's paper argued that the Chinese Government was working with Chinese diaspora community organisations and ethnic Chinese media as part of a united front strategy to advance Chinese political and economic interests in New Zealand. Chinese soft power influence in New Zealand included working with diaspora organisations and local media to cultivate relationships with New Zealand business and politicians from the country's two major parties, National and Labour. &&&&& &&&&& In late 2017, she started to become the target of a campaign of intimidation. A number of related properties were burgled, including her university office and home. progress was being made in the investigation and Interpol were involved.

The four Labour members of the justice select committee including chairperson Raymond Huo had decided to exclude Dr Brady on "procedural grounds" that her testimony had passed the deadline; Huo had been named as a pro-China influencer in Brady's "Magic Weapons" paper. Their action was criticized by the opposition National Party including electoral reform spokesperson Nick Smith. In response to media coverage and criticism from the National Party, the Labour Party announced that Huo had reversed his earlier decision and extended an invitation for Dr Brady to speak to select committee members. &&&&& &&&&& Selected works &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& *  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

He had a townhouse in New York City at 39 East 72nd Street. Winthrop's first summer home in Muttontown, New York (within the Town of Oyster Bay), now known as Nassau Hall, was designed by Delano & Aldrich around 1904. He had the firm build him another home next door, a 12,000 square foot mansion, in 1911. The 168 acre estate was purchased by Landsdell Christie, who sold the property to Nassau County in 1968. The 1904 home is today called Nassau Hall and houses the Nassau County Museum's administrative offices. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * 1901 Portrait of Winthrop's Father by John Singer Sargent at the Knickerbocker Club &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

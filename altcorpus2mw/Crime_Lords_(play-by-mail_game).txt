Armintrout reviewed ''Crime Lords'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 51. Armintrout commented that "I have to recommend ''Crime Lords''. I enjoyed it a great deal in spite of all the problems. The game is exciting, the gamemasters are good, and it has the feel of a role-playing game more than anything else. I just hope they rewrite the rulebook soon." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

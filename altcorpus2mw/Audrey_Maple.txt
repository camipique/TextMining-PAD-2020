Audrey Maple &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Audrey Maple, from a 1907 publication. &&&&& Audrey Maple LCCN2014693709 &&&&& '''Audrey Maple''' (1899 â€“ April 18, 1971) was an American actress, singer, and vaudeville performer, born '''Elsie H. Schroeder'''. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Audrey Maple was born Elsie H. Schroeder in Trenton, New Jersey. Her father was a musician. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Audrey Maple performed on vaudeville in a novelty act called ''Pianophiends''. In the operetta ''The Love Waltz'' (1908-1909), she was half of a highly publicized "eight-minute kiss" during a dance scene.  &&&&& &&&&& She appeared in Broadway productions, mostly musical comedies, including ''The Arcadians'' (1910), ''The Firefly'' (1912-1913), ''Molly O'' (1916), ''Katinka'' (1916), ''Good Night, Paul'' (1917), ''Her Regiment'' by Victor Herbert (1917), ''Monte Cristo Jr.'' (1919), ''Tangerine'' (1921-1922), ''Princess April'' (1924), ''Naughty Riquette'' (1926), ''My Princess'' (1927), ''Sunny Days'' (1928), ''Angela'' (1928-1929), and ''The Street Singer'' (1929-1930). &&&&& &&&&& Maple appeared in two films, ''The Plumbers are Coming'' (1929) and ''Enlighten Thy Daughter'' (1934). &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Maple's personal life involved enough gossip, scandal, and legal entanglements to prompt commentary in newspapers: "What again! It's perfectly terrible the way wives pick on poor little Audrey Maple, the pretty musical comedy star, and try to make out that she is a naughty girl." In 1928 she survived a car accident in Chicago that killed one of her co-stars, dancer Rosalie Claire. &&&&& &&&&& In 1940, Audrey Maple married engineer and inventor Ernest A. Zadig, and retired from the stage. She died in New York in 1971, aged 72 years. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * A photograph of Audrey Maple in the Billy Rose Theatre Collection Photograph File, New York Public Library Digital Collections. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

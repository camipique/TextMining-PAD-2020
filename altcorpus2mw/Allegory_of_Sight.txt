Allegory of Sight &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Allegory of Sight''''' is an oil painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger. The painting showcases varied objects associated with sight, the arts, and navigation. The painting was heavily influenced by ''The Five Senses'', a series of allegorical paintings done by the younger Brueghel's father, Jan Brueghel the Elder.  &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Allegory of Sight'' depicts a scene in which the Greco-Roman goddess Venus and her son Cupid examine an impressive collection of valuables.

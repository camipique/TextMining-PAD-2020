Berrilea &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Berrilea''' is a heritage-listed residence at 29 Summer Street, Orange, City of Orange, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by John Job (J. J.) Copeman and built by J. H. Gain. It is also known as '''Berrilee''' and '''Tabratong'''. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The house was designed by J. J. Copeman and built by J. H. Gain for Mrs Robert Frost in 1902. &&&&& &&&&& Being located in the main street of the town, opposite Cook Park, it is a key domestic architectural element in the townscape of Orange. Its location, landscape setting and high architectural quality indicate its importance. &&&&& &&&&& The house was first owned by Robert Frost (a major local brick-maker), and eventually was bought by P. C. Weston, whose daughter Miss F. Weston left it to the church for use in association with the adjacent Wontoma Private Hospital. Its bathroom was modified in the 1930s. &&&&& &&&&& Miss Weston became a patient in the nursing home in 1980 until her death on 14 December 1981. &&&&& &&&&& In 1983 Berrilea cottage bequeathed to the Uniting Church. The church's Wontama Village Nursing Home has been operating on parts of the site since 1967. The home (cottage) was initially considered for self-contained flats, but in May 1987 it became the Wontama Day Care Centre and incorporated the administration office. 24 self-contained units called "Carinya" (Happy home)') were opened in 1991. 1990 plans of the Wontama site show the proposed use of Berrilea as a day therapy centre, a use which did not eventuate at the location of the former stables. Another plan from 1990 approved by the Heritage Council was for demolition of the former tack room at the north of the stables to construct the Wontama Workshop. &&&&& &&&&& Orange City Council listed Berrilea on its Local Environmental Plan in 2011 as an item of state heritage significance. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The Edwardian house has wide wooden vernadahs, external lacework and a large formal garden and includes stables at rear (now a double garage).

Captain Thunderbolt's Rock &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Thunderbolt's Rock''' is a heritage-listed rock and now picnic site and tourist attraction located adjacent to the New England Highway in Uralla, in the Uralla Shire local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It is also known as '''Split Rock''' and '''Big Rock'''. The property is owned by Uralla Shire Council. It is one of a group of historic sites labelled '''The Captain Thunderbolt Sites''' for their association with bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, along with Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site, and Captain Thunderbolt's Grave. Collectively, all properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& On 27 October 1863, less than three months after escaping from Cockatoo Island, Fred Ward and Fred Britten laid in wait for the mail at Split Rock. Due to the increase in bushranging a police escort accompanied the mail to Uralla. The bushrangers were surprised by Sergeant Stephen Gardiner and Senior Constable Reynolds. &&&&& &&&&& A shootout ensued with the bushrangers escaping through the boggy ground of Church Gully (south of Thunderbolt's Rock). During the escape Fred Ward was shot through the back of the left knee and was later given medical assistance by a team of saw-pit men who confirmed the injury. Differing accounts were provided of who actually shot Fred Ward; Grainger or Reynolds. &&&&& &&&&& Seven years later Split Rock was to provide the first setting for Thunderbolt's last hold-up and final day. On the afternoon of 25 May Thunderbolt met the Blanchs at Split Rock, robbed them and then accompanied the pair back to their Inn. &&&&& &&&&& Thunderbolt's Rock provides an excellent vantage point to survey the surrounding countryside and in the bushranging career of Fred Ward is in the vicinity of many of his robberies. It is unknown when the name of the site was changed from Split Rock to Thunderbolt's Rock but this change reflects the connection of this site with Captain Thunderbolt both physically and within the psyche of the local community. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Thunderbolt's Rock is a huge cluster of granite rocks located approximately south of Uralla on the New England Highway. &&&&& &&&&& === Condition === &&&&& &&&&& As at 5 April 2012, good, although the site is heavily covered with graffiti. &&&&& &&&&& The integrity of the rock is high. &&&&& &&&&& === Modifications and dates === &&&&& There is a small carpark and picnic table located behind the rocks &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& As at 5 April 2012, Thunderbolt's Rock (originally known as Split Rock or Big Rock) contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt sites as one of the first sites associated with the transition of Frederick Ward from escapee to bushranger after his escape from Cockatoo Island in 1863. &&&&& &&&&& His attempted hold up of the mail at this site in November 1863 led to an altercation with police during which he was shot in the left knee; an event that was to prove important in his identification after his death in 1870. The shooting also is thought to have been an important formative event in the modus operandi of Captain Thunderbolt, preferring to run from, rather than face, police. &&&&& &&&&& Thunderbolt's Rock contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites as a site recognised by the public to be associated with Captain Thunderbolt.

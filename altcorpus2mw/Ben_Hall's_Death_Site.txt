Ben Hall's Death Site &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ben Hall's Death Site''' is a heritage-listed site at Billabong Creek, Ben Halls Road, Forbes, Forbes Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of a group of historic sites labelled the '''Ben Hall Sites''' for their association with bushranger Ben Hall, along with the Bushranger Hotel, Cliefden, Escort Rock, the Grave of Ben Hall and Wandi. It is also known as Blowclear Pastoral Run and Ben Hall's Place. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 October 2010. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Nelungaloo Station was formerly Blowclear pastoral run, which was owned by Thomas Morris in 1840. It was on land belonging to this property that on the 5 May 1865 Ben Hall was shot to death by police officers and Aboriginal trackers. &&&&& &&&&& At the end of April 1865 Hall, Gilbert and Dunn were in the vicinity of Forbes where they stole horses from Yamma Station and Gumbidgewa station. Meanwhile, Mick Coneley had turned from friend to informant lured by the 1000 pound reward for Hall and had been following the gang's movements and reporting them to the police. On 29 April a party of 6 police and 2 Aboriginal trackers lead by Sub Inspector Davidson left the police barracks in Forbes and "encamped in dense Scrub" about 10km from where they had been told the gang would meet. &&&&& Capture and death of bushranger Ben Hall &&&&& Gilbert and Dunn arrived at the rendezvous camp several days before Hall on 2nd May but were scared off by some local stockmen whom they mistook to be troopers. On the afternoon of 4th May Ben Hall arrived at the camp which was a dense area of scrub adjacent to Billabong Creek near Mick Coneley's hut. Sub-Inspector James Davidson, Sergeant James Condell, troopers Thomas Hipkiss, John Boyan, John Caban, Edward Buckley and Aboriginal trackers William (Billy) Dargin and Charley (Goolagong) were still waiting although they had run out of supplies. At six am on 5th May Hall emerged from the bush and walked towards his two hobbled horses, he was then shot multiple times by police. &&&&& &&&&& Hall's body, after being searched, was strapped to the back of one of his horses and taken to the Forbes police station. Davidson had hoped to keep Hall's death a secret in the hope of trapping Gilbert and Dunn, but it could not be done - there was too much excitement over Hall's death and reportedly his body attracted 400-500 people. &&&&& &&&&& A map of Hall's death site was drawn by Inspector Davidson as part of the police report on Hall's death, and is the basis for the site identification. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Ben Hall's Death Site is located between Forbes and Bogan Gate, approximately 19 kilometres northwest of Forbes. The site itself was marked by the Forbes Historical Society in 1957 with a metal plaque on a steel post. The site is a group of small trees on an otherwise treeless plain. The site is accessible by a small gate from Ben Hall's road and is adjacent to a dam. Billabong Creek, where Mick Coneley had his hut, is located to the north west of the site. The actual location of where the events of Hall's death took place has been ascertained using the notes and map of Inspector Davison which were reproduced in Peter Bradley's book "The Judas Covenant". &&&&& &&&&& A large painted sign with the story of Ben Hall's death is located near the entrance to the paddock. A dam was recently constructed nearby. &&&&& &&&&& It was reported as at 12 March 2009 that the site is unlikely to have archaeological potential, but that the Mick Coneley hut site does have archaeological potential. &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& Ben Hall's Death Site is associated with the introduction of the Felons Apprehension Act (Outlaws Act) which permitted police or anyone else to shoot on sight.

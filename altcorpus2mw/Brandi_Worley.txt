Brandi Worley &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Brandi Worley''' is a woman from Darlington, Indiana who murdered her two children on November 17, 2016. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& The victims were Tyler Daniel Clinton Worley (born 2009) and Charlee Rose Jean Worley (born 2013). Tyler attended the first grade at Sugar Creek Elementary School in unincorporated Montgomery County, Indiana. Charlee was enrolled in the Willson Early Learning Center preschool in Crawfordsville. He was 7 years old, and she was 3 years old. &&&&& &&&&& Brandi married a software engineer, Jason Worley, in August 2009, two years after their engagement. &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Hall of the ''Journal & Courier'' wrote that, according to Jason, "The two discussed separating in the past ... but they stayed together despite some friction." On November 15, 2016, Jason Worley requested a divorce. Brandi Worley's attorney stated that no prior child abuse had occurred. &&&&& &&&&& Murder &&&&& According to Joseph Buser, a prosecutor in the Montgomery County government, Brandi Worley bought the murder weapon, a Kabar combat knife, at a Walmart on November 16 on the pretense of getting pipe cleaners for a school project for Tyler. She initially placed the knife in Tyler's bedroom. &&&&& &&&&& As Jason slept in the basement of their residence, Brandi lured Tyler to Charlee's bedroom, stating there would be a sleepover there, fatally stabbed the children in their necks, and then cut her own neck. Brandi murdered her son before murdering her daughter. Finally Brandi called 9-1-1 to report the murders. &&&&& &&&&& The 9-1-1 dispatcher, initially hoping or believing the call was not legitimate, asked Brandi Worley's mother, who was the victims' grandmother, to check on the welfare of the children. After the mother-in-law found the children dead, her screams caused Jason to rise out of bed. Brandi told Jason "Now you can't take the kids from me." Police arrived around 4:30 A.M. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& Brandi Worley initially was admitted to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to treat her self-inflicted injuries. &&&&& &&&&& The funeral of the victims was held at the Darlington Community Center on November 22, 2016, and they were buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Darlington. &&&&& &&&&& YouTuber Philip DeFranco assisted Jason Worley after the father of the victims contacted him on Reddit. DeFranco asked his viewers to contribute to a GoFundMe account to pay for Jason Worley's immediate cost of living and the funeral of the children. &&&&& &&&&& In March 2017 the divorce initiated by Jason Worley became final. &&&&& &&&&& ===Legal proceedings and sentence=== &&&&& Brandi Worley was placed in the Montgomery County Jail in Crawfordsville while she awaited trial. &&&&& &&&&& Originally Brandi Worley pleaded not guilty and had a trial scheduled. In January 2018, Brandi Worley pleaded guilty to murder. On March 19, 2018, Judge Harry Siamas of the Montgomery Circuit Court sentenced Brandi Worley to 65 years for murdering Charlee and 55 years for murdering Tyler, giving her a consecutive total of 120 years in prison. Jason Worley stated "All I care is to never see Brandi Worley again. Out of sight and out of mind." &&&&& &&&&& Brandi Worley, in the Indiana Department of Corrections, is located in the Rockville Correctional Facility in Parke County, Indiana. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * " FULL PRESS CONFERENCE: Montgomery County Sheriff discusses double homicide." at RTV6 The Indy Channel by Sheriff of Montgomery County, Indiana Mark Casteel. &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

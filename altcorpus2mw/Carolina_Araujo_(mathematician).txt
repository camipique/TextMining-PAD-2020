Carolina Araujo (mathematician) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Carolina Bhering de Araujo''' is a Brazilian mathematician specializing in algebraic geometry, including birational geometry, Fano varieties, and foliations. She is a researcher at the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada in Brazil (IMPA), and the only woman (as of 2018) on the permanent research staff at IMPA. &&&&& &&&&& Araujo was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Araujo did her undergraduate studies in Brazil, completing a degree in mathematics in 1998 from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. She earned her PhD in 2004 at Princeton University, where her dissertation, supervised by János Kollár, was titled ''The Variety of Tangents to Rational Curves''. During and after her PhD, Araujo developed techniques related to Japanese mathematician Shigefumi Mori's proposed theory of rational curves of minimal degree, which she published in 2008. &&&&& &&&&& Araujo won L'Oreal Award for Women in Science in Brazil in 2008. &&&&& &&&&& Araujo is an organizer and invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians. She led the inaugural World Meeting for Women in Mathematics — (WM)2 in August 2018. She was also one of the female mathematicians profiled in the short documentary called ''Journeys of Women in Mathematics'', funded by the Simons Foundation. &&&&& &&&&& Selected bibliography &&&&& &&&&& * '''Carolina Araujo''', Stéphane Druel and Sándor J.

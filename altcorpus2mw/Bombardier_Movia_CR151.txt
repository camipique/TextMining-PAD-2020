It is also the first train to feature a massive redesign over the other previous rolling stock, including the sixth rolling stock, C151C. That includes a more streamlined body design with a unique headlight placement and also the first batch of trains to come with bright white LED headlights over the conventional fluorcent yellow lights. &&&&& &&&&& The trains also include several unique features, such as condition monitoring sensors and analytic systems to detect faults beforehand as well as an onboard self-test system that checks whether the train is fit for operation. In addition, four trains will also have an Automatic Track Inspection (ATI) system ,consisting of cameras, lasers and sensors, to detect rail defects. &&&&& &&&&& Furthermore, the trains would also have wider areas near the doors to aid the movement of passengers in and out of the train, and tip-up seats that cater to parents with prams, wheelchair users and people with personal mobility devices or foldable bicycles without reducing seat count. &&&&& &&&&& The trains will also utilise a Bombardier Mitrac propulsion and control system. &&&&& &&&&& It will be the third train type to be equipped with STARIS 2.0 during manufacturing process in which it will consists of 2 LCD screens displaying the travel information, such as the upcoming stations the train will arrive at, door closing warnings and attractions nearby the station. &&&&& &&&&& On 1 April 2019, Bombardier Transportation and the Land Transport Authority launched a mockup of the interior of the CR151 at the SG Mobility Gallery at LTA's office at Hampshire Road. A poll is also being done to collect public opinion on the features of the train such as the livery, interior colour scheme, the tip-up seats and the Additional Passenger Media Display (APMD). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

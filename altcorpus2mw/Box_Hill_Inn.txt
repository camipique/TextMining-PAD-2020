It is said to have been built in 1825. The front veranda has octagonal timber posts with beaded-edge wide timber ceiling linings. There are two front doors, one of six panels with a four-pane fanlight over and the other of eight panels and no fanlight. Windows are 12-paned with solid timber shutters. The front wall is stuccoed and tuck pointed to represent Flemish bond brickwork. &&&&& &&&&& Internally there are six panel and vertically boarded doors. Architraves have been removed, but one mantelpiece remains on site. Walls and ceilings are of plaster. The ceilings are a lime and mud mortar pressed into laths. There is a cellar under one room at the end and a separate brick kitchen wing that appear to have been built in the late Victorian or Federation periods. A timber-framed gabled roof with detailing typical of the early twentieth century links the two brick structures The gable roof is clad with corrugated steel. The end wall has been demolished and a new footing poured. The rebuilding of this wall was stopped by Baulkham Hills Shire Council who required a development application and concurrence of the NSW Heritage Council. &&&&& &&&&& Neat little early cottage, from , with the roof line sweeping down to a low profile over the front veranda. Several fruit trees remain - quince, citrus. A timber-framed shed stands to the rear in poor condition. Three wells lie to the rear and north of the house, two of them are unusually wide. &&&&& &&&&& Much of the Georgian character still remains with the Coach House at the rear. &&&&& &&&&& === Condition === &&&&& As at 4 May 2007, the general condition was fair. &&&&& &&&&& === Modifications and dates === &&&&& Unsympathetic alterations carried out some years ago, but would be easy to restore the facade (). &&&&& &&&&& The eastern end wall has been demolished and a new reinforced concrete footing poured. The rebuilding of this wall was stopped by Baulkham Hills Shire Council who required a development application and concurrence of the NSW Heritage Council.

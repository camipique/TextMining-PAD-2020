The season follows Oliver, a former billionaire businessman and politician, and the aftermath of outing himself as a vigilante. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe. The season is produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment. This is the first season with Beth Schwartz as showrunner following the departures of Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle. &&&&& &&&&& The season was ordered in April 2018. Production began that July, and ended in April 2019. Stephen Amell stars as Oliver, with principal cast members David Ramsey, Emily Bett Rickards, Echo Kellum, Rick Gonzalez, Juliana Harkavy, and Katie Cassidy Rodgers also returning from previous seasons. Colton Haynes, a principal cast member for seasons two and three and a special guest actor for seasons four and six, was reinstated as a series regular for the seventh season.

On April 2, The CW renewed the series for its seventh season. Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle stepped down as showrunners at the end of the sixth season, with veteran writer Beth Schwartz taking over as sole showrunner for the seventh season. Guggenheim, the series' co-developer, remains involved as an executive consultant. &&&&& &&&&& ===Writing=== &&&&& In May 2018, outgoing showrunner Marc Guggenheim revealed that the Longbow Hunters, a villainous organization in DC Comics, would be teased in the sixth-season finale before being introduced in the seventh season. Following the conclusion of the sixth season, which marked the first time in the series' history where the season's main antagonist was still at large, Guggenheim's successor Beth Schwartz confirmed that Ricardo Diaz / Dragon would return and, like his comic book counterpart, establish the Longbow Hunters, "a legendary group of assassins Diaz recruits to get back at Team Arrow for toppling his nascent criminal empire at the end of season 6." &&&&& &&&&& Schwartz revealed that "redemption" would be the theme of the seventh season, "since last season when Oliver outed his identity, the city is a little bit mixed about how they feel about the Green Arrow." Stephen Amell commented that there is "nothing about Oliver that's heroic" in the season premiere. While Schwartz confirmed that other characters would be influenced by the season's theme, she stated that after Black Siren committed several murders during her partnership with Diaz, she still has "a large way to go to redeem herself from last season." The previous season also left off with Team Arrow fractured and divided. This season sees its members redefining their roles and what it means to be heroes to an anti-vigilante Star City, while honoring "the sacrifice Oliver made for them." The showrunner named Felicity's storyline as one of her favorites for the season's first half. "We played her pretty parallel to Oliver, where she's hiding and not being herself. She's in protective custody, but when someone attacks her family, she can't ignore that, so she has to fight back." Schwartz also said that the season would be "grounded" and have a "dark" tone, similar to that of the first season. &&&&& &&&&& The seventh season is the first time the series will employ a female-dominated writing staff, with new writers being introduced this season. Schwartz said the seventh season would not be based on David S. Goyer's scrapped film ''Green Arrow: Escape From Super Max'', which would have featured Oliver Queen being arrested, exposed as the Green Arrow, and attempting a prison escape. Amell reported that the season would employ a new storytelling technique. This was later revealed to be sporadic flashforwards, as opposed to the weekly flashbacks of seasons past. Schwartz named ''Westworld'' and ''This Is Us'' as inspirations for the time structure, and ''Prison Break'' as an inspiration for the prison arc. Amell also revealed that he requested that the seventh season be written as if it were the series' last. &&&&& &&&&& ===Casting=== &&&&& Main cast members Stephen Amell, David Ramsey, Emily Bett Rickards, Echo Kellum, Rick Gonzalez, Juliana Harkavy, and Katie Cassidy Rodgers return from previous seasons as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow, John Diggle / Spartan, Felicity Smoak / Overwatch, Curtis Holt / Mr. Terrific, Rene Ramirez / Wild Dog, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, and Laurel Lance / Black Siren, respectively. The seventh season is the first not to feature original cast members Willa Holland and Paul Blackthorne, who play Thea Queen / Speedy and Quentin Lance, respectively, as series regulars following both actors' departures during the previous season. They did, however, reprise their roles for the series' 150th episode. On April 9, 2018, it was announced that Colton Haynes would return as a series regular for the seventh season after previously starring in the second and third seasons and making guest appearances in the fourth and sixth seasons as Roy Harper / Arsenal. On October 11, Kirk Acevedo was promoted to series regular status after previously recurring in the sixth season as main antagonist, Ricardo Diaz / Dragon. Sea Shimooka was introduced as a series regular during the season, playing Oliver's half-sister Emiko Queen. Kellum exited the series during the season, with the episode "Star City Slayer" marking his final appearance as a series regular. Acevedo also exited the series during the season, with the episode "Brothers & Sisters" marking his final appearance as a regular. On March 30, 2019, Rickards posted on Instagram that she would be leaving the series, making the seventh season her last on the show. Series co-creator Greg Berlanti and Schwartz confirmed her departure later that day. &&&&& &&&&& On July 21 at the series' San Diego Comic-Con 2018 panel, it was announced that the Longbow Hunters had been cast with Holly Elissa as Red Dart, Miranda Edwards as Silencer, and Michael Jonsson as Kodiak. It was also revealed that Michael Jai White, Vinnie Jones, and Cody Runnels would additionally recur as Ben Turner, Danny Brickwell, and Derek Sampson from previous seasons. On September 21, Katherine McNamara was cast in a recurring role as Maya, though her character was later revealed to be Oliver and Felicity's future daughter, Mia Smoak / Blackstar. Jack Moore returned in the role of Oliver's son William Clayton, with Ben Lewis portraying the character in flashforwards. Joseph David-Jones also recurs as Connor Hawke, John's adoptive son, in flashforwards. David-Jones previously played a future version of John's biological son John Diggle, Jr., who went by Connor Hawke / Green Arrow, in the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' first season episode "Star City 2046". In March 2019, Adrian Paul joined the series in a recurring role as Dante. &&&&& &&&&& ===Filming=== &&&&& Production for the season began on July 6, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In May 2018, Stephen Amell revealed that co-star David Ramsey would direct the eleventh episode of the season, marking Ramsey's directorial debut. Amell also grew a beard during the filming hiatus to accurately resemble the Green Arrow of the comics. Production wrapped on April 11, 2019. &&&&& &&&&& ===Arrowverse tie-ins=== &&&&& In May 2018, Stephen Amell announced at The CW upfronts that the next Arrowverse crossover would feature Batwoman and Gotham City. The crossover "Elseworlds" is slated to launch a 2019 solo series for the character. The episode "Emerald Archer" featured appearances from Grant Gustin and Caity Lotz as Barry Allen and Sara Lance, respectively, for the series' 150th episode. Joseph David-Jones reprises his role as John Diggle, Jr. / Connor Hawke from the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode "Star City 2046" where the character becomes the new Green Arrow in an alternate timeline. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& ===Broadcast=== &&&&& In May 2018, it was announced that ''Arrow'' would move to Mondays for its seventh season, a first for the series, due to The CW's programming expansion to Sunday nights. On June 20, the network released its fall schedule, revealing that the series would additionally move from the 9:00 pm time-slot to the 8:00 pm time-slot. The season premiered on The CW in the United States on October 15, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& ===Marketing=== &&&&& The main cast of the season as well as executive producer Beth Schwartz attended San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2018 to promote the season. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& ===Ratings=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Critical response=== &&&&& The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 90% approval rating for the seventh season, with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 174!reviews. &&&&& &&&&& Reviewing for ''Den of Geek'', Delia Harrington gave the premiere a rating of 3/5. She opined that Roy's inclusion in the season made his "moving sendoff" with Thea from last season feel "cheap" and that she remained "cautious" about the flashforward structure, but said that the episode was "solid" nonetheless. She concluded, "The ''Arrow'' Season 7 premiere manages to both wipe the slate clean and nod in the direction of the show's early glory." ''IGN''s Jesse Schedeen wrote, "''Arrow''s Season 7 premiere kicks off the most significant status quo change in the series' history. Some of these sweeping changes are already working in the show's favor." He gave the episode a rating of 7.1/10, adding, "''Arrow''s seventh season has a promising start, though the premiere drags whenever Oliver Queen isn't the focus." Both Chancellor Agard of ''Entertainment Weekly'' and Allison Shoemaker of ''The A.V. Club'' gave the premiere a "B" grade and noted a comparison to ABC's ''Lost'', with Agard praising Amell and Rickards' performances. Shoemaker explained that the episode "revisits a lot of familiar territory, but it breaks new ground for ''Arrow'' while having its priorities in precisely the right place. It's the beginning of a new era for ''Arrow'', and whether you credit this episode's success to either focus or flash-forwards, it's a promising start." &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

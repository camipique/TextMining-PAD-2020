After that, he was appointed Mathematical Master at George Watson's College (Edinburgh). In 1889 he was appointed Headmaster at Allan Glen's School (Glasgow) but he remained only two months because a severe pleurisy forced him to leave Scotland going to South Africa in search of a better climate. Back to Scotland, his health deteriorated rapidly and died in Glasgow thirty three years old. &&&&& &&&&& Alec married the singer Marjory Kennedy-Fraser in 1887 and they had a couple, David (1888–1962) and Helen Patuffa (1889–1967).

The project met with studio resistance and remained unmade until 2012, when Alex Cox had begun teaching film production at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He had the idea to have his students film an adaptation of the novel and suggested the idea to Harrison, who granted Cox an academic license to produce a student film and was working with Cox on the screenplay for the film at the time of his death in 2012. In March 2013, Cox launched a Kickstarter campaign, hoping to raise a goal of $100,000 to shoot the film. The Kickstarter campaign raised $114,957 from 1,106 backers. Cox also succeeded in getting a number of film professionals to work on a royalties basis. The film went into production in October 2013. Scenes were shot in university buildings. Iggy Pop, who wrote and performed the song "Repo Man" for Alex Cox's 1984 film, also wrote and performed the theme song for ''Bill, the Galactic Hero''. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& The film premiered in Boulder, Colorado on December 12, 2014. It gained positive reviews. It was later shown on New Year's Eve at the Clinton Street Theater. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

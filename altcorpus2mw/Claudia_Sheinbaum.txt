Claudia Sheinbaum &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo''' (born 24 June 1962) is a Mexican scientist, politician and incumbent mayor of Mexico City. She jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 as a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. She was elected as mayor on 1 July 2018 as part of the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition. She is the second woman to serve as mayor but the first to be elected and the first member of the Jewish faith to be elected mayor of Mexico City. &&&&& &&&&& Previously, Sheinbaum served as the Secretary of the Environment of Mexico City during Andrés Manuel López Obrador's term as mayor, and she was a governor of Tlalpan administrative borough from 2015 to 2017. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo was born to a secular Jewish family on 24 June 1962 in Mexico City, the second daughter of Carlos Sheinbaum Yoselevitz and Annie Pardo Cemo. Her grandparents emigrated to Mexico City from Lithuania and Bulgaria. &&&&& &&&&& Academic career &&&&& Sheinbaum studied physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). She graduated in 1989 with a B.S. in Physics, publishing a thesis on the thermodynamics of wood-burning stoves (). She received a masters in 1994 with a thesis on the economics of electric lighting (), and a PhD in Environmental engineering in 1996 with a thesis on residential energy use in Mexico (). &&&&& &&&&& She completed the work for her doctoral thesis at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on a grant from UNAM. She completed the Advanced Studies Program in Sustainable Development and the Environment at the Center for Demographic, Urban, and Environmental Studies (), and the Advaned Studies Program in Sustainable Development at El Colegio de México, and is thus a member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores and the Mexican Academy of Sciences. &&&&& &&&&& She was an advisor for the National Commission for the Saving of Energy and the Management of Economic Studies of the Federal Commission of Electricity (). &&&&& &&&&& She is a researcher at the Institute of Engineering at UNAM. In 2007, she joined the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the United Nations in the field of energy and industry, as an author on the topic "Mitigation of climate change" for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. This group would receive a Nobel Peace Prize that same year. In 2013, she authored the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report alongside 11 other experts in the field of industry. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& During her time as a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, she was a member of the Consejo Estudantil Universitario (''University Student Council''), a group of students that would become the founding youth movement of the Mexican Party of the Democratic Revolution. &&&&& &&&&& On 20 November 2000, she was appointed to the cabinet of the Head of Government of Mexico City Andrés Manuel López Obrador, taking the position of Secretary of the Environment of Mexico City on 5 December. During her term, she was responsible for the construction of the second level of the Periférico, a major highway system in Mexico City, the first Mexico City Metrobús line, and an electronic vehicle-registration center for Mexico City. She resigned from her position in 2006 in order to join López Obrador's presidential campaign as a spokesperson. Following the events of the 2006 Mexican general election and allegations of vote fraud against the winning National Action Party, she was named the Secretary of Defense of López Obrador's ''"Legitimate Government" ('''')''. &&&&& &&&&& In April 2008, together with other leaders, Sheinbaum organized the Movement for the Defense of Petroleum (), creating women's brigades which were called ''adelitas'', a reference to the women of the Mexican Revolution who created intense civil resistance demonstrations outside the Senate of the Republic. These ''adelitas'' protested against the short time allocated to legislate and debate energy reform, and against the presumed goal of the privatization of PEMEX. &&&&& &&&&& Andrés Manuel López Obrador included Sheinbaum in his proposed cabinet for the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources as part of his campaign for the 2012 Mexican general election. &&&&& &&&&& From the end of 2015, Sheinbaum served as the governor of Tlalpan. She resigned from the position upon receiving the nomination for candidacy of the mayor of Mexico City for the Juntos Haremos Historia (''Together We Will Make History)'' coalition, consisting of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), the Labor Party (PT), and the Social Encounter Party (PES). &&&&& &&&&& On 1 July 2018, Sheinbaum was elected as mayor of Mexico City. During the campaign Sheinbaum was accused by the PAN for the collapse of an elementary school that killed 19 children in an earthquake. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In 1986 she met Carlos Ímaz Gispert, to whom she was married from 1987 to 2016. She has one daughter from this marriage, and also became stepmother to filmmaker Rodrigo Ímaz Alarcón. &&&&& &&&&& Sheinbaum participated as a judge in the Latin American Independent Film and Documentary Festival of the Millennium () in Mexico City from 25–30 June in 2000. &&&&& &&&&& Abridged academic bibliography &&&&& Sheinbaum is the author of over 100 articles and two books on the topics of energy, the environment, and sustainable development.

ANO5 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Anoctamin 5''' ('''ANO5''') is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ANO5 gene. &&&&& Function &&&&& The ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions); these channels are known as calcium-activated chloride channels. The mechanism for this calcium activation is unclear. Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if damaged. &&&&& &&&&& The anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation. &&&&& &&&&& The anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. The anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth. &&&&& &&&&& Diseases associated with ANO5 mutations &&&&& Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2L (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi Distal Myopathy 3 (MMD3) &&&&& These forms of muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that to be affected a person must have mutations on both copies of the gene, and males and females are equally likely to be affected. &&&&& Clinically, LGMD2L and MMD3 were considered different diseases before ANO5 was identified as the responsible gene; LGMD was used to describe initial weakness in proximal muscles (near the center of the body) while MMD to describe initial weakness in distal muscles. &&&&& Typical Symptoms &&&&& &&&&& Other names for this gene &&&&& * ANO5_HUMAN &&&&& * anoctamin-5 &&&&& * GDD1 &&&&& * gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia 1 protein &&&&& * integral membrane protein GDD1 &&&&& * LGMD2L &&&&& * TMEM16E &&&&& * transmembrane protein 16E &&&&& &&&&& Chromosal location &&&&& * Cytogenetic location: 11p14.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 at position 14.3 &&&&& * Molecular location: base pairs 22,192,485 to 22,283,367 on chromosome 11 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109, GRCh38.p12) (NCBI) &&&&& &&&&& Credit: Genome Decoration Page/NCBI &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * LGMD2L Foundation &&&&& * Myonexus Therapeudics &&&&& * &&&&& * Novel ANO5 KO mouse provides new insight into LGMD2L pathogenesis &&&&& * wolframalpha ano5 &&&&& &&&&&

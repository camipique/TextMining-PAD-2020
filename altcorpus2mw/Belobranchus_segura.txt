Belobranchus segura &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Belobranchus segura''''' is a species of eleotrid sleeper goby which has been found In Indonesia on Halmahera and in Papua Barat and also on the Solomon Islands. It is an anadromous species in which the eggs laid are over rocky and gravel bottoms in freshwater streams and the free swimming larvae then drift downstream to the sea where they undergo a planktonic stage before migrating up streams to mature and breed. It feeds on small crustaceans and fish. The specific name honours the French hydrobiologist Gilles Segura for his contribution to the study of fish faunas. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Armstrong-Ringsted Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Armstrong-Ringsted Community School District''' was a school district headquartered in Armstrong, Iowa. &&&&& &&&&& Its area included sections of Emmet, Kossuth, and Palo Alto counties, and it served the communities of Armstrong and Ringsted. &&&&& &&&&& It operated Armstrong-Ringsted Elementary School, Middle School, and High School. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& It was established on July 1, 1979 by the merger of the Armstrong School District and the Ringsted School District. &&&&& &&&&& At one point the district joined a grade-sharing arrangement, in which a school district sends its students to another district's schools, that had been already established between the Sentral Community School District and the North Kossuth Community School District. On July 1, 2014 Armstrong-Ringsted merged with the Sentral district to form the North Union Community School District. The merger passed in the Armstrong-Ringsted district by 291-42 and in Sentral by 78-18, and the approval was through a total of 86% of voters in both school districts. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

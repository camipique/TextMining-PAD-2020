Città della Pieve Co-Cathedral &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The church &&&&& '''St Gervasius and St Protasius Church''' (Italian - ''chiesa dei Santi Gervasio e Protasio'') is the duomo of Città della Pieve. It is dedicated to Gervasius and Protasius. With Perugia Cathedral, it is the co-cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perugia-Città della Pieve. &&&&& &&&&& The first church on the site dates to between the 4th and 5th centuries. This was replaced by a Romanesque structure, which was itself rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 13th century. In the Gothic period a crypt was also built below the high altar on the remains of Etruscan and ancient Roman secular buildings. Few traces of these phases remain in the present church, built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The side chapels and bell tower belong to this period. &&&&& &&&&& Artworks &&&&& &&&&& * Perugino, ''Baptism of Christ'' (c.1510) and ''Madonna in Glory with Saints'' (1514) &&&&& * Antonio Circignani (''Il Pomarancio''), ''Betrothal of the Virgin'' (1620) and ''Madonna del Carmine'' (1528) &&&&& * Domenico Alfani, ''Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saints Martin and Mary Magdalen'' (1521) &&&&& * Giannicola di Paolo (attributed to), ''Madonna and Saints'' &&&&& * Salvio Savini, ''Enthroned Madonna with Saints'' &&&&& * Giambologna (attributed), wooden crucifix (1550). &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

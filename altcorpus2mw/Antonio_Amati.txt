Antonio Amati &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Antonio Amati''' (ca.1540 – 4 March 1607) was an Italian luthier, active from 1560 to 1605. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Born in Cremona, Andrea Amati's younger son and Girolamo Amati's brother, Antonio worked first with his father, then with his brother, in the same workshop. With the latter, he refined his construction technique and style. For about ten years, they co-signed their works with their Latinized names: "Antonius & Hieronymus Amati" &&&&& &&&&& Instruments &&&&& The instruments with the common label of Antonio and Girolamo can hardly be assigned to the individual brothers, even for experts. They worked extraordinarily cleanly and experimented on the construction of the violin, especially on the contours, vaults and f-holes. Characteristic is a recessed gorge, which is responsible for the warm tone of their exhibits. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * William Henley's ''Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers'', Brighton, Amati, 1973. &&&&& * Cacciatori, Fausto: ''Il DNA degli Amati'', Cremona 2006, . &&&&& * ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'' (MGG2), Personenteil Vol. 1, Bärenreiter, Kassel 1999. &&&&& * Stefan Drees: ''Lexikon der Violine'', Laaber-Verlag, Laaber 2004, . &&&&& * : ''Das Buch der Violine.

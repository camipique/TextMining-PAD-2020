223	Attorney_General_of_Bermuda
Attorney General of Bermuda &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Established in 1698, the '''Attorney-General's Chambers of Bermuda''' is the main legal advisor to the federal government and makes laws accessible to the public. From 1698-1999, the Attorney-General was also the main prosecutor in all criminal matters that pertained to the Bermuda courts. Attorneys-General are appointed by the Governor per the Constitution. All were public officers until 1999 when Lois Browne-Evans was appointed as the island's first political Attorney-General through election. Due to Bermuda's decision to have a political Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions now handles all criminal matters. Even though there are now two distinct offices, the Attorney-General is also considered Bermuda's Minister of Legal Affairs. &&&&& &&&&& List of attorneys general (since 1900) &&&&& &&&&& * Reginald Gray (1900-1919) &&&&& * Thomas Melville Dill (1920-1937) &&&&& * Joseph Trounsell Gilbert (1938-1952) &&&&& *J.

Although it was primarily a girl's school, boys were accepted at the lower grades. It was primarily a boarding school, but it also accepted a limited number of non-residents. Academic courses included English, mathematics, history, art, literature, science, a number of languages, astronomy, psychology, political science, and arithmetic.

The school had large classrooms, a music room with a pipe organ, an auditorium, a swimming pool, a bowling alley, and dormitories. In 1906, a three story addition was added with an alley bridge from the main building, that looked like a Venetian bridge. There were then a total of three buildings. Then, the trustees added a park and clubhouse by 1910. &&&&& &&&&& After Wolcott's marriage in 1912 and until 1922, Mary Kent Wallace ran the school.

Burra Bee Dee Mission &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Burra Bee Dee Mission''' is a heritage-listed former Indigenous Australian mission and still in use cemetery at Oxley Highway, Coonabarabran, Warrumbungle Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1892 to 1957. It is also known as '''Forked Mountain'''. The property is owned by Coonabarabran Local Aboriginal Land Council and the Department of Trade & Investment, Regional Infrastructure & Services (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 June 2004. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Burra Bee Dee Mission was founded in 1908. In 1892 Mary Jane Cain who originally lived on the river bank close to town who used to run goats of which would get away from her and head to Forky Mountain. It was this that eventually made Cain and husband to build a place out at Forked Mountain for her to stay. Cain wrote to Queen Victoria on numerous occasions requesting that the land was to be granted to her. Queen Victoria granted that Burra Bee Dee or part thereof be handed to Cain and Queen Victoria requested that Mary Jane was to manage the property and was required to provide a place for the dark people (''sic'') to live on. The land there was later reserved for Aboriginal use and in the early 1900 was brought under the control of the Aboriginal Protection Board and became a managed station. Burra Bee Dee Aboriginal Reserve was gazetted on the 21 February, and it was made of three reserves in existence: in 1892, one of ; in 1906, one of ; and in 1911, one of . Other major camps in the Coonabarabran area that were not under the Board control included the showgrounds and Gunnedah Hill. &&&&& &&&&& Burra Bee Dee was originally known as Forky Mountain after the hill that dominates the landscape. The mountain was the reason for Cain's visit to the place to shepherd her goats back to Coonabarabran. The land which was originally granted to Cain was officially known as Forky Mountain until the name was changed to Burra Bee Dee somewhere around 1911. The significance of the name Burra Bee Dee is an Aboriginal word meaning flying mice. Just as the Mountain is a significant and organising feature of the landscape it is often a significant and organising feature of the language, the stories of Burra Bee Dee. Forky Mountain was significant to the people of Burra Bee Dee as it was a birthplace, a place for burials and a food source. &&&&& &&&&& The first hut on the mission was built by Cain and her husband which was a boarded house with tin and bark and a dirt floor. With the influx of Cain's extended family and other families from around the district peoples dwellings ranged from bag houses made of Hessian bags, tents, and bark and kerosene - tin shacks. To the two roomed fibro houses built during the peak of the managers days. The shacks were built in clusters and added to when needed. The clusters were known by the women who ran them Granny Cain, Queenie's place and Granny Fuller's. The only houses built in rows facing the road were the five or six fibro houses that the government built in later times. &&&&& &&&&& Not only was the Burra Bee Dee mission used by Aboriginal people as a place for dwelling other areas such as Gunnedah Hill and Coonabarabran Showground were also other places of dwelling. Although neither groups in the beginning liked each other they all eventually ended up living at Burra Bee Dee. &&&&& &&&&& In 1924 two women came to Burra Bee Dee as Missionaries. They lived and worked with the people for 30 years and were very much an institution in Burra Bee Dee life. Mr Marney one of the Burra Bee Dee residents built the church for the missionaries to live in on the mission. The women held sewing classes which every year they held a show. Church was held every Sunday morning with Sunday school in the morning for the children and church of an afternoon. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The site covers approximately of land which includes the mountain known as Forky Mountain. Throughout the area there is no physical buildings, remains or objects of former dwellings such as housing, school or the church. &&&&& &&&&& The only remaining site at Burra Bee Dee Mission is the cemetery which is still currently being used by the local community. &&&&& &&&&& In the early 1970s the original school house was removed and is being used for private use. &&&&& &&&&& As at 16 January 2004, certain specific areas within the boundary were reported to have high potential for archaeological evidence. These included the main area of the mission and surroundings and at the base of Forky Mountain. &&&&& &&&&& The community would like to preserve the area and enable educational visits and tours to the area to promote Aboriginal heritage. Enhancements such as an interpretation trail around the main area of the mission and possibly a cultural centre to house the memorabilia and artefacts and educational information about life on the mission. &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& Burra Bee Dee Mission and Forky Mountain is of State significance as it maintains and continues to show the historical process and activities and is a place of occupancy of Aboriginal people from the district.

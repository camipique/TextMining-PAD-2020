Cramér's theorem (large deviations) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Cramér's theorem''' is a fundamental result in the theory of large deviations, a subdiscipline of probability theory. It determines the rate function of a series of iid random variables. &&&&& A weak version of this result was first shown by Harald Cramér in 1938. &&&&& &&&&& Statement &&&&& The logarithmic moment generating function (which is the cumulant-generating function) of a random variable is defined as: &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Let be a sequence of iid real random variables with finite logarithmic moment generating function, e.g. for all . &&&&& &&&&& Then the Legendre transform of : &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& satisfies, &&&&& &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& for all &&&&& &&&&& In the terminology of the theory of large deviations the result can be reformulated as follows: &&&&& &&&&& If is a series of iid random variables, then the distributions satisfy a large deviation principle with rate function . &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

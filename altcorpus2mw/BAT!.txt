BAT! &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''BAT!''' are an American psychobilly all-star group from Hollywood, California featuring members of Stellar Corpses, ''The Brains'', Nekromantix, and ''Rezurex''. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& Originally starting as a side project by Stellar Corpses front man Dusty Grave and Rene De La Muerte of ''The Brains'' and Nekromantix, they later added ''Rezurex'' lead Daniel DeLeon on vocals and guitar. &&&&& &&&&& Their stage persona takes on that of masked vigilante crime-fighters wearing all black with matching fedora hats and bat shaped masks. They take many visual cues from classic pulp and noir magazines such as The Shadow from the 1930's and Will Eisner's Spirit. &&&&& &&&&& Before the name BAT! was chosen there had been other combinations of their friends playing together but they were each just for a particular gig or two. Founded in the early 2018 BAT! was officially put together for a ''Batcave Records'' industry showcase in Las Vegas. For this particular event they had invited Daniel DeLeon to play with them. It was here that they were introduced to Brian Perera the CEO of Cleopatra Records. A few weeks later Brian had signed them to his label &&&&& &&&&& They are currently endorsed by Gretsch Guitars. &&&&& &&&&& Members &&&&& &&&&& *Daniel DeLeon – Vocals and Guitar &&&&& *Dusty Grave – Upright Bass and Vocals &&&&& *Rene De La Muerte – Stand up Drums and Vocals &&&&& &&&&& Albums &&&&& ===LP/CD's=== &&&&& *''TBA'' (2018) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official website &&&&& * Official Facebook Page &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Christopher Marlowe in fiction &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Anonymous 16:th century portrait, believed to be Christopher Marlowe &&&&& Christopher Marlowe (1564 – 1593), English playwright and poet, has appeared in works of fiction since the nineteenth century. He was a contemporary of William Shakespeare, and has been suggested as an alternative author of Shakespeare's works, an idea not accepted in mainstream scholarship. Marlowe, alleged to have been a government spy and frequently claimed to have been homosexual, was killed in 1593. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& * Wilbur G. Zeigler's novel ''It was Marlowe'' (1895) was the first book to argue that Marlowe's death was faked — apparently in support of Zeigler's claim that Marlowe was the actual author of ''Hamlet'', which was written after Marlowe's recorded death. &&&&& * Philip Lindsay's ''One Dagger For Two'' (1932), a fictionalized biography. &&&&& * Herbert Lom's ''Enter a Spy: The Double Life of Christopher Marlowe'' (1978), a historical novel. In this story Marlowe has an affair with Frances Walsingham. &&&&& * In "Men of good fortune", an issue of Neil Gaiman's ''The Sandman'', Marlowe and Shakespeare discuss ''Doctor Faustus''. Shakespeare openly laments that Marlowe is the greater poet, which attracts Dream's attention. &&&&& * Anthony Burgess's ''A Dead Man in Deptford'' (1993) was the last of Burgess's novels to be published in his lifetime. Marlowe is portrayed as a homosexual secret agent. &&&&& * Marlowe is a main character Harry Turtledove's ''Ruled Britannia'' (2002), an alternate history depicting an England where the Spanish Armada was successful in 1588 and imposed the rule of King Philip II of Spain. In this depiction, Marlowe is still alive in 1598 and is, with Shakespeare, active among conspirators seeking to overthrow Spanish rule and restore the imprisoned Queen Elizabeth. Ingram Frizer is tasked with killing him, but Marlowe is instead slain by the spaniard Lope de Vega. &&&&& * Louise Welsh's 2004 novel ''Tamburlaine Must Die'' about Marlowe's last days is an "alternative fictional account as to what really went on". It is written as a journal-entry by Marlowe. &&&&& * In ''History Play'' (2005) by Rodney Bolt, Marlowe fakes his death and flees England. &&&&& * Marlowe plays a major role in Elizabeth Bear's ''The Promethean Age'' novels (2006–2013). In this account Marlowe and Shakespeare had a secret, deeply emotional homosexual love affair and many of Shakespeare's Sonnets were written to express his love for Marlowe. In this story Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch Morgan le Fay. &&&&& * M. J. Trow's ''The Kit Marlowe Series'' (2011–), depicts Marlowe as a detective and spy for Sir Francis Walsingham. Trow has also written non-fiction about Marlowe. &&&&& * In Ros Barber's verse novel ''The Marlowe Papers'' (2012), Marlowe looks back on his past and faked death and his writing of the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. It won the Desmond Elliott Prize for 2013. &&&&& *Marlowe appears in ''Shadow of Night'' (2012) by Deborah Harkness, the second book in the ''All Souls Trilogy''. Marlowe, a daemon, is one of many historical figures in this story. &&&&& * Michelle Butler Hallett's ''This Marlowe'' (2016) explores the relationship between Thomas Kyd and Marlowe, and gives an account of Kyd's interrogation and the murder of Marlowe. &&&&& * ''The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.'' (2017) by Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland features Marlowe in a minor role, having faked his death as a means of becoming a more effective spy. &&&&& &&&&& Theater, film and television &&&&& * Leo Rost's ''Marlowe'' (1981), was an American rock musical staged on Broadway. &&&&& * Peter Whelan's play ''The School of Night'' (1992), about Marlowe's links to the freethinking "The School of Night" and the young Shakespeare, was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon. &&&&& * Rupert Everett portrays Marlowe in the film ''Shakespeare in Love'' (1998). &&&&& * John Hurt plays Marlowe, who still lives as a vampire in the 21st century, in Jim Jarmusch's ''Only Lovers Left Alive'' (2013). The film was nominated for a Palme d'Or in 2013. &&&&& * Marlowe is a character in the 2015 comedy ''Bill''. &&&&& * Marlowe (played by Jamie Campbell-Bower) is a main character in the 2017 TNT series ''Will''. &&&&& *Marlowe (played by Tim Downie) is a main character in Ben Elton's Shakespeare-sitcom ''Upstart Crow''.

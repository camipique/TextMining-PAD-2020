Bear Creek (Neuse River) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Bear Creek''' is a tributary of the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA. It drains an area of intensive agriculture, and is heavily polluted with nitrates. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& &&&&& Bear Creek is a tributary of the Neuse River, the largest river in North Carolina. &&&&& The creek rises in the east of Wayne County, North Carolina, &&&&& Wills Pond to the north of New Hope Road impounds Old Mill Branch, a tributary of Bear Creek that enters from the right (west) near the creek's headwaters. &&&&& Further north Bear Creek W/S Lake Number Three impounds the headwaters. &&&&& The creek flows southeast on the county line between Wayne and Greene counties, it enters northwest Lenoir County and flows southeast to the Neuse River. &&&&& Bear Creek flows south under U.S. Route 70 between Goldsboro and Kinston. &&&&& &&&&& The creek is named in local records as early as 1742. &&&&& Originally a bottom land swamp, it was drained by canals to allow farming in the early 20th century. &&&&& Bear Creek today drains an agricultural watershed, including crops and intensive animal farming. &&&&& Land use in the watershed is 67% agriculture, 25% forest, 5% water or wetland and 3% urban. &&&&& The creek is primarily fed by groundwater. &&&&& &&&&& Restoration efforts &&&&& &&&&& The creek receives high levels nitrate from frequent runoff of surface water. &&&&& Nitrogen delivery into the stream is enhanced by using tile drains to channelize runoff. &&&&& Bear Creek was continuously monitored from May 2002 to May 2003. &&&&& Drainage ditches in the watershed sometimes had nitrate concentrations above 10 mg/L. &&&&& Nitrate yields in the creek exceeded 810 kg N km−2. &&&&& In an effort to restore the creek's natural functions, more than of drainage canals were backfilled in the Bear Creek-Sleepy Creek Core Restoration Area. &&&&& The large earthen levees were removed and replaced by lower, more natural structures to retain water. &&&&& The area was then planted with almost 50,000 young trees in 2001. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

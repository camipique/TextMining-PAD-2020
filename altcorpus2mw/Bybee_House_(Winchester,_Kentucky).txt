Bybee House (Winchester, Kentucky) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bybee House''' is a historic building located south of Winchester, Kentucky, United States. The original part of the house was two rooms that were constructed of logs. A frame addition was added to the single-pen log core, creating a center-passage plan house. Log structures were prominent in this part of Clark County as the economy was much more modest than elsewhere. The 1Â¾-story structure features stone chimneys on the exterior and simple Greek Revival details on the interior. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

ASP Derick Abraham (Mammootty), after another person is killed, figures out that the serial killer is a hard-line Christian, using the killer's note, and those being targeted are atheists. He captures the killer: Brother (Christian) Simon of the local seminary. Bro. Simon tells him he will definitely reach his target of 10 people. When Derick leaves and comes back, Bro.Simon is found dead with a slash on his throat and a knife in his hand, presuming he committed suicide, revealing the tenth person was himself. Derick is suspended due to this. &&&&& &&&&& His family consists of only his younger brother Philip Abraham (Anson Paul), who is a training as a sharp shooter. Their parents died in a car accident when they were young. Philip is later accused of killing his girlfriend Aleena (Tarushi) while drunk, and is severely beaten up by Derick's senior officer, Narayana Sethupathi (Yog Japee). Derick is forced to arrest his beloved brother as the evidence is against him. Philip pleads that he's innocent and has been trapped. Unable to cope with his brother's arrest, Derick becomes a drunkard. &&&&& &&&&& Meanwhile at the jail, Phillip starts to hate him and vows to kill Derick once he's released. Dinesh (Siddique), the jail warden, hears this and tells him he can help with the escape to settle his personal score with Derick. The latter had once arrested the Dinesh's and Narayana's sons in a kidnapping case. Narayana's son committed suicide before being arrested, so these two have a grudge against Derick. Philip, with the help of Dinesh and Narayana, later escapes prison. &&&&& &&&&& Philip's close friend Nisam (Anoop Vijay) meets Derick and discloses the events that occurred in the fateful night of the murder of Philip's girlfriend. On that night, Philip was with Nisam and two of his other friends, Arun (Maqbool Salmaan) and Salman. He was heavily drunk and fell asleep. Aleena called to meet him at the beach but Arun answered the phone and reached the place with the others instead. They physically assaulted her and she got killed in the process. Derick, on realizing this, now wants to convince the police department that Phillip is innocent. However, the next day Nisam commits suicide. &&&&& &&&&& Philip, in the meanwhile, attempts to kill Derick in a supermarket but fails. Derick finds Arun and Salman at a car wash and tells them to surrender but they refuse and fight him instead. The child of Derick's ex-girlfriend, Diana (Kanika), is kidnapped and despite her hatred towards Derick, is forced to seek his help and he accepts. To avoid any harm to her, the ransom money of Rs. 10 million is arranged and Derick goes with the police keeping a safe distance. The kidnappers are shown to reach the place and take the money but they don't release the kid. The police follow and catch them, but on inquiring comes to know that they were paid to be the decoy. CI Sukumaran (Kalabhavan Shajohn), who was Derick's close acquaintance, tells Diana, Dinesh, Narayana and SP Shahul Hameed (Renji Panicker), the head of the investigation, that all this is part of a plan by Derick and Philip. It was their plan to escape prison in the first place, make the others believe that there was hatred between them and kill Arun and Salman: the real culprits. Derick wanted to get Philip out of the country for his safety and secure his life, with the help of Issac (Shyamaprasad), so the ransom amount was used for this purpose. However, all this was done without leaving any evidence. &&&&& &&&&& Derick emotionally bids farewell to Phillip as he leaves. At the police station, DYSP Johnny mocks Derick of his suspension 3 years before. However, it's revealed that Derick actually killed Bro.Simon and cleared up the evidence. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& * Mammootty as Derick Abraham &&&&& * Anson Paul as Philip Abraham &&&&& * Kanika as Adv.

Blues Bred in the Bone &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Blues Bred in the Bone''''' is an album by trombonist Ray Anderson which was recorded in 1988 and released on the Enja label. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "Unlike on his previous ''Old Bottles - New Wine'' recording, trombonist Ray Anderson's high-note technique gets the better of him on this set. He often comes across as a one-line Las Vegas comedian who constantly exclaims, "Look how high I can play!" ... this has to be considered one of Anderson's lesser efforts". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All compositions by Ray Anderson except where noted &&&&& # "Blues Bred in the Bone" – 7:58 &&&&& # "53rd and Greenwood" – 8:04 &&&&& # "Mona Lisa" (Ray Evans, Jay Livingston) – 4:46 &&&&& # "Datune" – 5:19 &&&&& # "A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing" (Billy Strayhorn) – 6:22 &&&&& # "Hemlines" – 7:56 &&&&& # "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" (Bennie Benjamin, Eddie Durham, Sol Marcus, Eddie Seiler) – 5:10 &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Ray Anderson – trombone &&&&& *John Scofield – guitar &&&&& *Anthony Davis – piano &&&&& *Mark Dresser – bass &&&&& *Johnny Vidacovich – drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

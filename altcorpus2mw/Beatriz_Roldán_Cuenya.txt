Beatriz Roldán Cuenya &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Beatriz Roldán Cuenya''' (born 1976 in Oviedo) is a Spanish physicist working in surface science and catalysis. Since 2017 she has been director of the Department of Interface Science at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin (Germany). &&&&& &&&&& Professional career &&&&& &&&&& Roldán Cuenya studied at the University of Oviedo (Spain) and received her doctorate degree from the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany). As a postdoc she worked at the University of California, Santa Barbara and subsequently became professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando (USA). In 2013, she accepted a Chair Faculty position in Solid State Physics at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Germany). Since 2017 Roldán Cuenya has been a Director at the Fritz Haber Institute, where she heads the Department of Interface Science. &&&&& &&&&& Her main research interests are the synthesis of nanostructured materials with tunable surface properties and the experimental investigation of structure-reactivity relationships in thermal and electro-catalysis using ''in situ'' and ''operando'' methods. Applications of her work are in the areas of environmental remediation and energy conversion. &&&&& &&&&& Awards and distinctions &&&&& &&&&& * 2005 NSF-CAREER Award of the American National Science Foundation &&&&& * 2009 Peter Mark Memorial Award, American Vacuum Society &&&&& * 2009 University of Central Florida, Research Incentive Award &&&&& * 2016 Fellow of the Max Planck Society at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion (Mülheim, Germany) &&&&& * 2016 European Research Council Consolidator Award &&&&& &&&&& Publications &&&&& * I.

265	Adenosine_deaminase_2_deficiency
Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency''' is a vasculitis syndrome. It is due to mutations in the ADA2 gene which encodes the adenosine deaminase 2 protein. The clinical features of this condition are protean and it may be easily missed. &&&&& &&&&& Signs and symptoms &&&&& &&&&& The age of onset of symptoms is variable: 24% of reported patients present before 1 year of age. 77% present before the age 10 years. Adult onset has also been described. 5-10% die from this disease by the age of 30 years. &&&&& &&&&& Like all vasculitis syndromes the features depend on which is organ is involved. Most commonly the gut, kidney and liver are affected. &&&&& &&&&& It may affect the skin (livedo reticularis and livedo racemosa) or brain (stroke). Polyarteritis nodosa in children is also known to occur. &&&&& &&&&& Other conditions associated with this syndrome include hypogammaglobulinemia, pure red cell aplasia, immune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. &&&&& &&&&& Genetics &&&&& &&&&& The ADA2 gene is located in the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.1). &&&&& &&&&& Over 60 pathogenic mutations have been recognised in ADA2. In all clinical cases to date both copies of the gene have been mutated implying a recessive inheritance. &&&&& &&&&& Pathopysiology &&&&& &&&&& This is not understood. The gene is expressed in myeloid cells and macrophages but its function is not known. &&&&& Diagnosis &&&&& ===Differential diagnosis=== &&&&& &&&&& This includes common variable immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure and idiopathic aplastic anemia. &&&&& &&&&& Treatment &&&&& &&&&& Thalidomide, tumour necrosis factor antibodies and in severe cases bone marrow transplantation have been used successfully. &&&&& &&&&& Epidemiology &&&&& &&&&& This is a rare condition with less than 200 cases reported. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& This condition was first reported in 2014. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Chezib of Judah &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& '''Chezib''', also known as '''Achziv''' of Judah (), is a biblical place-name associated with the birth of Judah's son, Shelah (Genesis 38:5), corresponding to the ''Achziv'' of the Book of Joshua (15:44), a town located in the low lying hills of the plain of Judah, known as the Shefela. In ''I Chronicles 4:22'', the town is rendered as ''Chozeba''. The place is now a ruin. &&&&& &&&&& Historical geographers identify the site as ''Khirbet a-Sheikh Ghazi'', the old name preserved in the name of a nearby spring ''ʻAin el-Kezbeh'', a place in the Elah Valley near Moshav Aviezer, directly south of Bayt Nattif. Its name is allegedly derived from Shelah’s son, Cozeba, who is mentioned in I Chronicles (4:22). Formerly, the site had tentatively been identified with ''Tell el-Beide'', a site now known as ''Tell Libnin'', while others placed its location at one of the unidentified ruins near ''Khirbet Qila'' and ''Khirbet Beit Nesib''. Like many of the ruins of ancient cities in Israel, the site has no very well-defined characteristics, but appears to be spread over a considerable area. &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& &&&&& The name ''Chezib'', etymologically, is derived from the word "disappointment," "delusion," "failing" or "lying." In the Aramaic Targum of Pseudo-Yonathan ben Uzziel on Gen. 38:5, as well as in Genesis Rabba (§85), Chezib is rendered as ''Paskath'', said to be the Aramaic equivalent of Chezib ("failing"). &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Lachish Letters makes mention of a certain "Beit Achzib" in the Shefelah, the lower stratum of the Judean range, believed to be the Chezib of Judah. Eusebius, in his ''Onomasticon'', notes of the place that "there the sons of Judah were born; now a desolate place, shown in the territory of Eleutheropolis near Adullam." &&&&& &&&&& In classical Hebrew literature, the town is mentioned as being confederate with Pekah the son of Remaliah, the king of the northern tribes of Israel, for which it incurs the divine wrath of the prophet Micah, who uses a play on words to denounce the towns of Maresha, Achzib, and Adullam. Israelite potters are said to have occupied the site during the preëxilic, late First Temple period. The site is shown in the 1880 map published by Conder & Kitchener's ''Survey of Western Palestine''. Today, the site has mostly been planted over with pine trees by the Jewish National Fund (''Keren Kayemet''). &&&&& &&&&& ===Site's distinguishing features=== &&&&& The site is strewn with the remains of razed buildings, and thick walls that are partially standing and which were constructed of fieldstones. Within the environs of the site is a burial chamber built in the face of a cliff, containing six ''kokîm'' (niches) and which, according to C.R. Conder, signifies a Jewish burial place, dating back to a period before the nation became subject to the Western powers of Greece and Rome. The site has revealed archaeological relics dating back to the Iron Age, until as late as the Byzantine period. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& File:Burial cave entrance - Chezib of Judah.jpg|Near ''Khirbet Ghazy'' (Chezib of Judah), showing entrance to burial cave &&&&& File:Burial tomb with niches, Chezib.jpg|Niches within burial cave near Chezib of Judah &&&&& File:Old stone structures at Chezib (Kh.

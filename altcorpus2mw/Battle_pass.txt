Battle pass &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& A '''battle pass''' is a type of video game monetization that provides additional content for a game usually through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items by playing the game and completing specific challenges. Inspired by the season pass ticketing system and originating with ''Dota 2'' in 2013, the battle pass model gained more use as an alternative to subscription fees and loot boxes beginning in the late 2010s. &&&&& &&&&& Concept &&&&& ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' features a dual-track battle pass. The "free" track (''top'') is free to all players but offers fewer rewards compared to the "premium" track (''bottom''), which requires seasonal payment via microtransactions. &&&&& Within a video game, a battle pass may be offered free to a player, or may require the player to purchase it through microtransactions. Once obtained, the battle pass presents the player with a number of reward tiers; by earning enough experience to complete the tier, the player gains the rewards offered at that tier. These rewards are generally cosmetic in nature, such as character and weapon customization options (aka "skins"), emotes, and other non-gameplay affecting elements. More desirable rewards are provided at higher levels, which offer a way for players to show off these unique customization options to other players as a status symbol. Experience is gained through normal gameplay, and often through in-game challenges, while some games offer a way to accelerate progression through a battle pass by using microtransactions. In games that offer both free and paid-for battle passes, the free pass may have a very limited number of tiers, but will track progress of the player's progression through the paid-for battle pass, allowing them to buy that battle pass at any time to reap the rewards. &&&&& &&&&& Battle passes and the rewards contained are only available for a limited time, most commonly a few months, after which a new season battle pass with a new set of rewards are available to be acquired. Battle passes may be called different terms depending on the game. For example, ''Rocket League'' and ''PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds'' offers a "Rocket Pass" and "Event Pass" respectively, while ''Dota 2'' formerly called theirs a "Compendium". &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& One of the first known examples of a battle pass concept was seen in Valve Corporation's ''Dota 2'' during an event that surrounded The International 2013, the annual esports tournament for the game. Called the "Compendium", it provided unique in-game content and other features for those players that purchased it, with 25% of all revenue made from it going towards the prize pool for the event. Since, Valve continued to offer passes for the game, introducing a permanent form of one with their "Dota Plus" subscription feature in 2018. Valve also added "campaign passes" to ''Team Fortress 2'' with special events from 2015 onward. The campaign pass gave the player that purchased it a number of goals to complete during the event to receive unique customization options. &&&&& &&&&& The popularity of these passes grew in significantly 2018 with the use in Epic Games's ''Fortnite Battle Royale''. Its runaway success on a scale rarely seen before drew great interest towards its monetization methods. The free-to-play game adopted a "season"-driven release schedule, each season lasting 10 weeks, during which a new set of cosmetic items and emotes were offered. The newly coined "Battle Pass" was added starting in its second season, during a time when the game was seeing a large growth in its player base and has been used by the game since. Battle passes are purchased through an in-game currency (V-bucks) which either must be purchased with real-world funds via microtransactions, or earned via the ''Fortnite: Save the World'' cooperative game mode. Analyst Michael Pachter estimated that on the first day of the third season, in February 2018, Epic sold more than five million battle passes, generating over in revenue in a single day. With expansion of ''Fortnite'' to mobile devices in March 2018, revenue estimates from the game were in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month in the following months, primarily from battle pass sales. &&&&& &&&&& At the same time as ''Fortnite'' was becoming a success, the video game industry had been dealing with the issue of loot boxes, another monetization scheme where players spend funds to open boxes containing a random assortment of in-game items. From late 2017 onward, the use of loot boxes was under scrutiny from the industry and several government-related groups, believing they encouraged gambling, particularly for young players. Battle passes were then seen as a more preferable option to loot boxes, as players would be able to see all the rewards they could earn, even if they needed to spend a great deal of time completing all the tiers, assuring players continued to play the game. Further, by offering the means for players to buy into completing tiers, publishers could also see additional revenue. &&&&& &&&&& Coupled with the success of ''Fortnite'' battle pass approach and exhaustion over loot box controversies, other publishers started to evaluate battle pass use, with gaming journalists theorizing that games which formerly relied on loot boxes or worked as a service could begin to offer battle passes as a replacement. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

CEASE therapy &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''CEASE''' (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) therapy is used by naturopaths (particularly homeopaths) who claim, without evidence, that it can treat or even cure people with autism. It involves a mixture of supplements, high-dose vitamin C, 'orthomolecular support', dietary restrictions and homeopathy and was developed by Dutch doctor Tinus Smits. Smits claimed to have used it to treat over 300 children with autism. The therapy became more notable in 2017/2018 because of regulatory action taken by professional bodies in The Netherlands, UK and Canada following a series of complaints about unfounded claims. &&&&& &&&&& Smits in the book "Autism Beyond Despair - CEASE Therapy" stated that autistic children should never be vaccinated. &&&&& &&&&& In October 2017 the Dutch Advertising Code Foundation (Stichting Reclame Code) found that the official website for CEASE therapy was in breach of advertising regulations. &&&&& &&&&& In the United Kingdom, in April 2018 the Professional Standards Authority (PSA) placed some requirements on the Society of Homeopaths (SoH) when they reaccredited their members' register under their Accredited Register scheme, due to concerns about the way in which members marketed CEASE therapy. The PSA asked the SoH to confirm "what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation". In June 2018 the Society of Homeopaths published a position statement advising their members not to imply any cure of autism when marketing CEASE therapy. It has been estimated that more than 120 homeopaths are offering CEASE in the UK though not all are SoH members. In its December 2018 accreditation review for the Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT) the PSA received confirmation from the Federation that none of its registered homeopath members offer CEASE, that any homeopath who offers CEASE would not be accepted onto its register and additionally that the FHT does not "accept, endorse or insure" CEASE therapy. &&&&& &&&&& In July 2015 the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found Teddington Homeopathy's marketing of CEASE therapy in breach of the Advertising Standards Code. The following month the ASA added the company to its list of non-compliant online advertisers for "making unproven efficacy claims for CEASE therapy". In May 2018 the ASA wrote to homeopaths to remind them that "CEASE Therapists cannot claim to cure autism or make claims regarding detoxification" and in July 2018 they upheld an adjudication against Bubbling Life's website, determining that the claims relating to CEASE, vaccination, autism and ASD could discourage customers from seeking appropriate advice or treatment. In March 2019, the ASA published a statement that advertising of CEASE must stop and that they had referred several case to Trading Standards. &&&&& &&&&& In British Columbia, Canada, the Board of the College of Naturopathic Physicians investigated three CEASE practitioners following complaints from the public and subsequently "determined that naturopathic doctors in British Columbia must not advertise or offer CEASE therapy". As well as this prohibition the College's updated position statements also clarify that naturopathic doctors in BC must not offer anti-vaccination materials or advice (including on social media) and must not imply that vaccination causes autism. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * Disturbing claims by homeopaths at The Irish Times, 2012 &&&&& * CEASE therapy for autism: Homeopathic quackery and “self regulation” by naturopathic boards at Science-Based Medicine, 2018 &&&&& * A Spectrum of Harmful interventions for Autism: a short report (PDF) from The Westminster Commission on Autism, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

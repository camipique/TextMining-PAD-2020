335	Centreforce
Centreforce &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Centreforce''' also known as '''88.3 Centreforce''' and '''Centreforce Radio''' is a former pirate radio station, now legally broadcasting to London on DAB radio. It was instrumental during the Second Summer of Love period of acid house and rave music culture in the UK. &&&&& &&&&& Early history &&&&& Centreforce first broadcast on the 8th May 1989, from Newham, East London on the frequency of 88.3 FM. In its short time on air (it ceased broadcasting little over a year later around May/June 1990), it became the "first seven day rave station" , and a pivotal part of the scene, promoting all of the big M25 raves of the time such as Genesis, Energy, Sunrise, and Biology. Regular DJs on the station included DJ Randall (3 Amigos), Kenny Ken (as Players Kenny), Danielle & Rochelle, Keith Mac, Gary D, DJ One, Corporation Dave, DJ Huggs, DJ Connie, Hermit, and Jazzy J. &&&&& &&&&& Centreforce was set up by Andy Swallow who also co-ran the Echoes nightclub in Bow, East London. Swallow was also involved with the infamous football hooligan firm Inter City Firm (ICF), and controversy around the ICF and its relationship to Centreforce regularly surfaced. &&&&& &&&&& Centreforce Sessions &&&&& &&&&& After a brief return to the airwaves in 2007-2008 on 88.4FM, Centreforce teamed up with Time 107.5, a local legal radio station based in Romford, East London. Centreforce produced the weekend output on the station as ''Centreforce Sessions'' with shows and DJs including Jumping Jack Frost, Artful Dodger, Soul Syndicate (Peter P, Chris Phillips), Matt Jam Lamont, and Mr Buzzhard. This ran from June 2009 until April 2012 when a change of management at Time FM saw the relationship parting company. &&&&& &&&&& Internet and DAB Launch &&&&& &&&&& Having returned once again throughout 2017 hosting weekly shows online, as of December 2017 Centreforce announced that they had been awarded a license to broadcast to London on DAB. As of 14th July 2018, it commenced broadcasting on the Switch London 2 digital radio network. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Centreforce Radio &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

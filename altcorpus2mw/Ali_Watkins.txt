Ali Watkins &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Ali Watkins''' (born 1992) is an American journalist who writes for ''The New York Times''. Along with two colleagues, she was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for a body of work consisting 10 articles spanning from March 3, 2014, to July 14, 2014. Watkins has worked for a number of publications, including ''BuzzFeed'', ''Politico'', McClatchy, ''The Huffington Post'', and the ''Philadelphia Daily News''. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Watkins was born and raised in Berks County, Pennsylvania. She is a graduate of Temple University, where she was a news editor for ''The Temple News''. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& In 2014, while she was still a senior in college, Watkins broke a national story about the Central Intelligence Agency monitoring United States Senate computers while the Senate Intelligence Committee was preparing a report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program. For their work on the story, Watkins and two other journalists were named as finalists for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in National Reporting. Watkins' career progression has been characterized as "meteoric" by ''The Times'' of London and "stunning" by ''The Washington Post'', and she has been called a "hotshot" by Fox News. &&&&& &&&&& For several years, Watkins' beat was the Senate Intelligence Committee. At ''The New York Times'', Watkins covered law-enforcement agencies from its Washington, D.C. bureau until July 2018, when the ''Times'' reassigned her to the New York office. &&&&& &&&&& From December 2013 to December 2017, Watkins was in a romantic relationship with the former head of security for the Senate Intelligence Committee, James A. Wolfe. The FBI opened an investigation into Wolfe after an April 2017 article by Watkins described contacts between Russian spies and Donald Trump policy adviser Carter Page, who had not been publicly identified in relation to those contacts. On October 15, 2018, Wolfe pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI about his relationship with Watkins.  Prosecutors alleged that Wolfe leaked to Watkins and three other reporters. Watkins denied that Wolfe ever provided her classified information. Watkins disclosed the relationship to her employers BuzzFeed News, ''The New York Times'', and ''Politico''; however, McClatchy editors said they were ignorant of the relationship while Watkins was an intern and employee from mid-2013 through 2014. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

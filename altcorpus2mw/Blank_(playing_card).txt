322	Blank_(playing_card)
Blank (playing card) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The Nine of Acorns, a typical blank from a German-suited, Württemberg-pattern pack &&&&& A '''blank''' is playing card in card-point games that is a non-counter or is worth nothing. &&&&& &&&&& The names of the non-counters varies from region to region and game to game. In Poker they are blanks, bricks or bombs. In the German games of Schafkopf, Doppelkopf, Sixty-six and Skat, the 7s, 8s and 9s in all card suits are ''Luschen''. In the popular Swiss game of Jass the ''Luschen'' are the 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s; unlike Skat, however, the 9 of trumps, "Nell", is worth 14 points and is thus an exception; it ranks in the hierarchy immediately below the highest trump card, the Jack or Unter of Trumps (20 points) and above the Ace of Trumps (11 points). In most versions of Schafkopf, the 6s are also blanks. There are no blanks in games like Whist or Bridge, because they are plain-trick games where it is the number of tricks that counts, not the value of the cards won. &&&&& &&&&& Similar nicknames are given to very low-scoring cards. For example, in Tarock games, tarocks and pip cards score 1/3 of a point and are called ''Glatzen'' or ''Glatz'n'', ''Skartindeln'', ''Skatindeln'' or ''Skartins''; and suit cards other than court cards are also called ''Ladons'', ''Latons'' or ''Ladonis''. Low-value poker cards may be called ''rags''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Bamberger, Johannes (2011). ''Tarock: Die schönsten Varianten.'' 22nd edition.

Casebook PBC &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Casebook PBC''' is a US cloud computing public-benefit corporation headquartered in New York City. Incubated by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the company initially developed child welfare solutions and has since expanded to provide a SaaS platform servicing the whole of Human Services. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Casebook initially started as a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation under the leadership of Kathleen Feely, who was Vice-President for Innovation at the foundation. After early success with private service providers, the software was spun out into its own non-profit organization, known as Case Commons. &&&&& &&&&& In 2012, Indiana's Department of Child Services was the first state agency to implement Casebook as a mobile and web-based solution for its child welfare caseworkers. This effort led to the organization receiving the Design for Experience Award in 2014 and a Code for America Technology Award in 2015. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, the organization helped the state of California's Child Welfare Digital Services agency learn how to build and ship software. That same year, under the leadership of a new CEO, Tristan Louis, Casebook PBC entered into a national partnership with KPMG, allowing KPMG to leverage the Casebook platform as its exclusive solution for the child welfare vertical and rebranded from Case Commons to Casebook PBC. &&&&& &&&&& Products &&&&& The company offers the Casebook Platform, a set of core components that can be used for a variety of Human Services software developments. Because of its historical background in the Child Welfare space, the company also offers a suite of applications that, when put together, can allow states to assemble a CCWIS-ready child welfare system. &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& Official Company Site: &&&&& Casebook PBC is a certified B-Corp &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Cyprien Lefebvre de Lézy &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Cyprien Lefebvre de la Barre, chevalier de Lézy''' (16 December 1643 – March 1687), or '''Cyprien Lefèvre, Le Febvre''', was governor of the French colony of Cayenne (French Guiana) from 1665 to 1667, and again from 1670 to 1679. &&&&& During his term of office the colony was raided first by the English and then by the Dutch. &&&&& &&&&& Family &&&&& &&&&& Cyprien Lefebvre was born on 16 December 1643. &&&&& His father was Antoine Lefebvre (died 1669), sieur de la Barre, a counselor in parliament and provost of the merchants of Paris. &&&&& His mother was Madeleine Belin. &&&&& His eldest brother was Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre (1622–1688), governor of Cayenne from May 1664 to June 1665. &&&&& In 1665 the French Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert commissioned Antoine Lefebvre de La Barre as the king's governor of the American Mainland. &&&&& He was later governor of Cayenne for the king from 1668 to 1670 and governor general of New France from 1682 to 1685. &&&&& The family dynasty ended with Antoine's son, François Lefebvre de La Barre, who was governor of Cayenne from 1687 until his death in 1691. &&&&& &&&&& First term of office (1665–67) &&&&& &&&&& Antoine Lefebvre left Cayenne for France in 1665 and obtained the appointment of Cyprien as governor from the newly created Royal West Indies Company (Compagnie Royale des Indes Occidentales). &&&&& Cyprien Lefebvre was governor of Cayenne from 1665 to 1668. &&&&& He replaced the acting governor Antoine de Noël de la Trompe d'Or, who left office on 8 September 1655. &&&&& &&&&& On 20 June 1665 Lefebvre ceded a property in Cayenne to Joseph-Fortuné Pignon, vicomte de Quincy. &&&&& This became the property of the Jesuits in 1668 and their base in the colony. &&&&& &&&&& In 1666 the English commanded by Captain Peter Wroth visited the colony of Cayenne but did not harm Lefèvre. &&&&& Cayenne was looted by the British under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman in August 1667. &&&&& The English destroyed Fort Cépérou and the town of Cayenne. &&&&& Lefebvre left on 23 September 1667. &&&&& From December 1667 the Jesuit father Jean Morellet was the de facto governor. &&&&& After peace was restored in 1668 Lefebvre's brother Joseph-Antoine de La Barre returned, and held office until 1670. &&&&& &&&&& Second term of office (1670–79) &&&&& &&&&& Cyprien Lefebvre again took charge of Cayenne in 1670, and held office until March 1679. &&&&& He was commander from 1670 to 1675, then governor from 1675 to 1679. &&&&& On 21 May 1671 he was received as a Knight of Malta and made a lieutenant general. &&&&& He was governor of the French West India Company in 1674, when its possessions were returned to the king. &&&&& &&&&& In the spring of 1676 the Dutch captain Jacob Binckes was promoted to vice-admiral and dispatched to the West Indies with a fleet of seven men of war and six other ships. &&&&& He arrived at Cayenne on 4 May 1676 and landed 900 troops near Fort Saint Louis (Fort Cépérou) the next day. &&&&& Lefebvre soon surrendered. &&&&& Binckes left shortly after for Marie-Galante and Tobago, leaving a small force to hold Cayenne. &&&&& The Dutch commander Binkes controlled the colony from 5 May 1676 to 20 December 1676. &&&&& The Dutch left in December, defeated by the Comte Jean II d'Estrées. &&&&& In 1679 Lefebvre was replaced as governor by Pierre-Eléonore de La Ville, marquis de Férolles. &&&&& Cyprien Lefebvre died in Malta in March 1687. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Citations &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

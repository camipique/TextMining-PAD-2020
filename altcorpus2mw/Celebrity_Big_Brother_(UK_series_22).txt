Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 22) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Celebrity Big Brother 22''''', also known as '''''Celebrity Big Brother: Eye of the Storm''''', was the twenty-second and final series of the British reality television series ''Celebrity Big Brother''. It launched on 16 August 2018 on Channel 5 and ended after 26 days on 10 September 2018. It was the fifteenth celebrity series and twenty-second series of ''Big Brother'' overall to air on Channel 5. For the first time since 2011, the celebrity edition aired before the main series with ''Big Brother 19'' launching after the final in September 2018. ''Celebrity Big Brother 22'' was the final celebrity series in the three-year contract which was announced on 19 March 2015. Emma Willis returned as host of the series, while Rylan Clark-Neal continued to present ''Celebrity Big Brother's Bit on the Side''. &&&&& &&&&& On 10 September 2018, Ryan Thomas was announced as the winner of the series, with Kirstie Alley as the runner-up. &&&&& &&&&& On 14 September 2018, it was confirmed that this was the final series of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' to air on Channel 5 after their decision to axe the show. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& ===Eye logo=== &&&&& The official logo was released on 18 July 2018 (18 years after the first episode of ''Big Brother'' aired on Channel 4) and featured an eye consisting of neon lights including lightning bolts coming out of a stormy background. &&&&& &&&&& ===Creative team=== &&&&& Endemol confirmed that a new creative team had been formed ahead of the series. Paul Osborne, executive producer of ''Big Brother 7'', returned to overlook the new series as Creative Director. Tamsin Dodgson was also announced to return as Executive Editor. Trevor Boris was also later hired as a senior producer after co-producing ''Big Brother Canada'' since its inception. &&&&& &&&&& ===House=== &&&&& On 15 August 2018, the official house pictures were released. The house is inspired by Californian design, and has been dubbed "a house within a house". The technical layout of the building has also undergone a revamp since the previous series, and the entry staircase has been closed-off for the first time since Channel 5 took over the ''Big Brother'' format, in order to "keep the outside out" according to the creative director Paul Osbourne. &&&&& &&&&& There is also an outdoor lounge at the bottom of the garden, similar to the one in ''Big Brother 10'', compared to Channel 5's usual choice to incorporate the lounge within the main living area. &&&&& The new living area has a large circular dining table at the centre, with a kitchen counter at one side. There is a leaf-print decor, complimented by palm-style plants and additional seating. &&&&& &&&&& There is one bedroom, located behind the kitchen, with the palm theme continued with blue beds and pink accents. Adjoined to the sleeping quarters is the spare bathroom, which features a roll-top bath and vanity table. &&&&& In the garden, the snug has been replaced by a "pool room", a plush pink haven where the housemates can relax on padded loungers. The nearby sliding doors open up onto a dual swimming pool and hot tub deck, with which a mini cocktail bar is nearby. &&&&& &&&&& ===Stormy Daniels=== &&&&& In the months prior to the live launch, there was wide speculation that adult film star Stormy Daniels would enter the house, with reports saying that she would be paid £750,000 for just one week in the house — making her the highest paid housemate in the show's history. Despite the reports, she did not enter the house on launch night. &&&&& &&&&& A ''Big Brother'' statement issued the following day read: "Stormy Daniels was booked to appear on the show several months ago and hours before the show was due to go live, informed the production team that she no longer wished to enter the house as previously agreed. Producers discussed a variety of options with her but were unable to agree any acceptable conditions for her entering the house. Our focus is now on making a brilliant series with our fantastic celebrities." &&&&& &&&&& Daniels claimed that she offered to appear on the show during the live launch to explain her absence, but was turned down by producers. She also claimed that an interview on ''Loose Women'' where she was due to explain her side of the story was blocked by Channel 5. &&&&& &&&&& On the 17 August edition of ''Bit on the Side'', Clark-Neal explained that just five hours before the first live show, Daniels said she only wanted to appear on launch night and then leave. ''Big Brother'' tried to agree to a compromise, but nothing came of it. Clark-Neal also insisted that money was not a factor and there was no attempt from producers to try to manipulate Daniels to achieve a specific outcome. &&&&& &&&&& Housemates &&&&& On Day 1, thirteen housemates entered the house during the launch. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Celebrity &&&&& &&&&& Age on entry &&&&& &&&&& Notability &&&&& &&&&& Day entered &&&&& &&&&& Day exited &&&&& &&&&& Status &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ryan Thomas &&&&& &&&&& 34 &&&&& &&&&& Actor &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Kirstie Alley &&&&& &&&&& 67 &&&&& &&&&& Actress &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Dan Osborne &&&&& &&&&& 27 &&&&& &&&&& Reality TV star &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Nick Leeson &&&&& &&&&& 51 &&&&& &&&&& Rogue trader &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sally Morgan &&&&& &&&&& 66 &&&&& &&&&& Psychic &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Gabby Allen &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&& Reality TV star &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Hardeep Singh Kohli &&&&& &&&&& 49 &&&&& &&&&& Comedian and presenter &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 23 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Jermaine Pennant &&&&& &&&&& 35 &&&&& &&&&& Footballer &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 19 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Roxanne Pallett &&&&& &&&&& 35 &&&&& &&&&& Actress &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 17 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ben Jardine &&&&& &&&&& 37 &&&&& &&&&& Reality TV star &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 16 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chloe Ayling &&&&& &&&&& 21 &&&&& &&&&& Model &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 13 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Rodrigo Alves &&&&& &&&&& 35 &&&&& &&&&& Media personality &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 10 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Natalie Nunn &&&&& &&&&& 33 &&&&& &&&&& Reality TV star &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 9 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Ben Jardine=== &&&&& Ben Jardine is a British reality television personality and millionaire property tycoon, best known for his appearance on Channel 4's reality show ''Married at First Sight'' in 2017.

She chose Jermaine. &&&&& * : Following Chloe's eviction, viewers were given the power to nominate. A free poll on the Big Brother app allowed viewers to pick their favourite housemate. The two housemates with the fewest votes – Ben and Jermaine – were "nominated", and the remaining housemates were called to the diary room one-by-one to select which of the two housemates they would like to evict. After an initial tie of 4-4, Big Brother asked the housemates to vote again face-to-face by a show of hands. Nick switched his vote, and Ben was subsequently evicted on Day 16. &&&&& * : This week the housemates made one nomination, rather than two. Any housemate who received a nomination faced eviction. &&&&& * : For the final three days, the public were voting for who they wanted to ''win'', rather than save. &&&&& &&&&& Ratings &&&&& Official ratings are taken from BARB.

When describing fellow housemate Dan Osborne he said that he was "too white for his taste", and he would prefer to have a "nigger boy". Rodrigo was given a formal and final warning by Big Brother regarding this incident, but Big Brother and Channel 5 were criticised by fans, with some of them questioning why he was not removed from the house immediately, using the example of Emily Parr's removal from the 2007 series to justify their reasons, and for the airing of the word on the highlights show. However on Day 10, Rodrigo was removed from the house, after an unaired "further incident". &&&&& &&&&& ===Roxanne Pallett assault claim=== &&&&& &&&&& Another controversy on the series however came from Roxanne Pallett, who claimed that Ryan Thomas "deliberately" punched her like a "boxer punches a bag", despite the footage showing differently. She later slept in the spare bedroom, after she claimed that she felt uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as him. Following the incident, Ryan was given a warning, and maintained that he did it with "no malice". Roxanne later branded him a "liar", and a "woman beater". &&&&& &&&&& Following this, 21 ''Emmerdale'' actors criticised Roxanne for her behaviour, with Charley Webb branding her as "Outrageous" , as well as Sammy Winward tweeting that it was "a long time coming". Kelvin Fletcher, who played her on-screen husband Andy Sugden in the soap said that the incident was "calculated and manipulative beyond belief" whilst also showing support for Ryan. Within four days, Ofcom received over 25,000 complaints, making this the most complained incident regarding any ''Big Brother'' show since the race row in 2007. Furthermore, a petition launched to get her removed from panto work scheduled for Christmas reached over 4,000 signatures within two days. In the early hours of Day 17, Roxanne decided to voluntarily leave the house. Two days after her departure, on 3 September 2018, she returned for an interview with Willis, which was shown during that night's eviction show, where she apologised, stating she had made a "horrible mistake" but also stated she wanted to be "forgiven" for her actions. This incident been called "punchgate" by the press. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official website &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

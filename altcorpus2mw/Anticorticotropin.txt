179	Anticorticotropin
Anticorticotropin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& An '''anticorticotropin''', or '''anticorticotrophin''', is a drug which opposes the actions of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in relation to their stimulatory effects on the adrenal glands, or which otherwise suppresses steroid hormone production in the adrenal glands. They can be said to have '''anticorticotropic''' (or '''anticorticotrophic''') effects, and are used to treat Cushing's syndrome, prostate cancer, hyperandrogenism, and other conditions. &&&&& &&&&& Some examples of anticorticotropins include the following: &&&&& &&&&& * Corticosteroids, including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, which exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis to maintain homeostasis &&&&& * High-dose estrogens and antiandrogens, which can partially suppress adrenal androgen production &&&&& * Certain progestins such as megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate, which likely work via their weak glucocorticoid activity &&&&& &&&&& Conversely, drugs that stimulate CRH and/or ACTH secretion and/or activate adrenal steroidogenesis, such as antiglucocorticoids like mifepristone, antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone, and adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors like ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, and aminoglutethimide, have ''corticotropic'' or ''procorticotropic'' effects. &&&&& &&&&& Anticorticotropins are analogous to antigonadotropins and procorticotropins are analogous to progonadotropins. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * ACTH stimulation test &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

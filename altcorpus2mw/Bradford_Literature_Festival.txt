Bradford Literature Festival &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bradford Literature Festival''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''BLF''') is a spoken and written word event that promotes literature and is held for ten days annually over June and July in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. The first event was held in 2014 and was attended by 968 people; by the time of the 2017 event, the attendance had risen to over 50,000. The event is also noted for its attendance by minority groups and writers. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Festival was started by Syima Aslam and Irna Qureshi in 2014 for a weekend. By the time of the 2017 event, they had a full-time staff of seven besides themselves with funding from Bradford Council, the Arts Council and the National Lottery. After the short weekend festival in 2014, the event was lengthened to cover ten days which was held across late June/early July for the 2017 and 2018 festivals. The 2016 event was held in late May of that year. The festival is a series of events held at different locations across the Bradford District including bookshops, schools, colleges, the Alhambra, Bradford City Hall and art galleries. Whilst the emphasis is on the written word, some parts of the event include the arts, theatre, film, music and talks by famous people such as the former boxer, Frank Bruno, who in 2018 talked about his life and mental illness at the closing Sunday of the festival. &&&&& &&&&& A comic-con event in 2017 was so successful that organisers brought it back for the 2018 event bigger than the year before. &&&&& &&&&& In 2018, as a celebration of the 200 years since Emily Brontë's birth, the festival installed four stones with text about the Brontë's at strategic points between Thornton and Haworth. Jeanette Winterson, Carol Ann Duffy, Jackie Kay and Kate Bush have each written a piece of poetry that will adorn the four stones. &&&&& &&&&& Events &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& + &&&&& &&&&& Date &&&&& &&&&& Attendance &&&&& &&&&& No of events &&&&& &&&&& Notable people &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2014 &&&&& &&&&& 968 &&&&& &&&&& 24 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 15–24 May 2015 &&&&& &&&&& 11,000 &&&&& &&&&& 150 &&&&& &&&&& Shabnam Khan, Brian Patten, Sukina Owen-Douglas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 20–29 May 2016 &&&&& &&&&& 32,000 &&&&& &&&&& 200 &&&&& &&&&& Carol Anne Duffy, Nadiya Hussain, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 30 June–9 July 2017 &&&&& &&&&& 50,0000 &&&&& &&&&& 300 &&&&& &&&&& Jeanette Winterson, Joanna Trollope, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Germaine Greer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 29 June–8 July 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 400 &&&&& &&&&& Frank Bruno, Suzi Quatro, Kate Bush &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Full programme for 2018 &&&&& * BBC video of pupil exchange between Bradford and Hay festivals &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

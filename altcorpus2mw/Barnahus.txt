119	Barnahus
Barnahus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Barnahus''' (derived from a Scandinavian word for "children's house") is a concept for a comprehensive child-friendly centre for child victims of abuse that evolved in the Nordic countries. It has its roots in the Child Advocacy Model that originated in the United States in the 1980s. Iceland was the first Nordic country to implement the concept (called ''barnahús'' in Icelandic) in 1998, followed by Sweden (called ''barnahus'' in Swedish) in 2005, Norway (called ''barnehus'' in Norwegian) in 2007 and Denmark (called ''børnehus'' in Danish) in 2013. It has become known as Barnahus in English, a term that may be derived from either the original Icelandic ''barnahús'' or from Swedish ''barnahus''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

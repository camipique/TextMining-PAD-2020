The walls of this house, built in a modern building, have been preserved, and it can be assumed that it was built in the middle of the 18th century. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1800s, the owner of the mansion was a merchant Ivan Vasilyevich Chetverikov. Under him the building was rebuilt: the first floor was significantly expanded and there was a second. In 1845, a wooden mezzanine appeared near the mansion. In 1863, a two-storey building was added to the Eastern facade. At the end of the 19th century, the owner of the estate was a merchant Nikolai Osipovich Sushkin, in which new decorative elements appeared on the facades and interiors of the house. Under the Soviet regime, the mansion became one of the buildings of the children's trauma clinic № 20 Timiryazeva. &&&&& &&&&& By the end of the 20th century the mansion was dilapidated, and in 1987 the project of its scientific restoration was developed, which provided for the reconstruction of the appearance of the building for 1860-1870-ies. However, this project has not been realized for a long time. The mansion was empty, homeless people settled in it, and then there was a fire. &&&&& &&&&& In 2003, on the basis of children's city clinical hospital № 20 named after K. A. Timiryazev, The research Institute of emergency children's surgery and traumatology was established, and construction of a new building began near the Chetverikov house. There were plans to demolish the Chetverikov house, construction on its place of a two-level underground Parking and the subsequent "reconstruction" of the mansion.

Howling recreated numerous decorative elements: plaster column capitals, window frames, base, pilasters, and stucco facade brackets, pediments and corbels. The brickwork was restored.

Austrocidaria anguligera &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Austrocidaria anguligera''''' is a species of moth in the family Geometridae. It is endemic to New Zealand. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& This species was first described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1879 using specimens collected by Frederick Wollaston Hutton in Dunedin and given the name ''Phibalapteryx anguligera''. George Vernon Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1898 book as a synonym of ''Hydriomena gobiata''. In his 1928 publication ''The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand'' Hudson again illustrated and discussed the species, but under the name ''Eucymatoge anguligera'' following Edward Meyrick's placement of the species within that genus. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to a new genus ''Austrocidaria''. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Butler described the adult moths of the species as follows: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Distribution &&&&& This species is endemic to New Zealand.

Animal Science Products v. Hebei Welcome Pharmaceuticals &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Animal Science Products v. Hebei Welcome Pharmaceuticals''''', 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case before the Supreme Court of the United States involving the interpretation of foreign law in US domestic courts. The case arose out of a controversy in which Hebei Welcome Pharmaceuticals (Hebei), a company incorporated under Chinese law, and its parent company North China Pharmaceutical Group was accused of price fixing in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act by Animal Science Products (ASP), which filed a class action against Hebei. When the case was before the district court, Hebei claimed that Chinese law required them to price-fix, and this claim was supported by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in written submissions to the court, but this defense was denied on the grounds that there was no evidence that Chinese law actually imposed this requirement; a jury awarded damages to ASP. On appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the district court erred by entering into an independent review of foreign law, and that it should have instead, for reasons of international comity, deferred to China's representation of its own law, provided that this representation was "reasonable". In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the Second Circuit, finding that respectful consideration must be granted to a foreign government's statements, but not conclusive effect. The case was the first time that the Chinese government appeared as an amicus curiae in oral argument before the US Supreme Court, and was only the third time that any foreign government appeared as an amicus. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

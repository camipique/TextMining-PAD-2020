Biblioteca Civica Girolamo Tartarotti &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Biblioteca Civica Girolamo Tartarotti''' is the public library of Rovereto located on Corso Angelo Bettini #43, and forms part of the modern (2002) cultural center, including the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto or ''MART'', built adjacent to the 18th-century Palazzo Annona in the town of Rovereto, region of Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The library is named after the local 18th-century polymath and author, Girolamo Tartarotti (1706 â€“ 1761). His will left his library to the local Charity Hospital, in hopes of becoming the start of a communal collection. A few years later, in 1764, the city purchased the collection, and created a public library, with the help of the local academic society (l'Accademia degli Agiati). Enlarging the collections over the years, in 1852, the library was moved from small quarters in the town center at vicolo San Giuseppe, to the Palazzo Piamarta across the Corso Bettini from the Palazzo Annona. In 1921, they were moved to the Palazzo Annona. Now the facilities mainly occupy space within the large cultural complex behind the palace. The main reading room was located in the ground floor of the Palazzo Annona. &&&&& &&&&& From 1997 until 2002, the Cultural Center of Rovereto was built; known as the MART, it comprises the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Rovereto (MART), the Melotti Auditorium, and the library. The building was designed by Mario Botta. Restoration of the adjacent Palazzo Annona was completed in 2007.

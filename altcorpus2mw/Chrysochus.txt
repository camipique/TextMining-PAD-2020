264	Chrysochus
Chrysochus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Chrysochus''''' is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from North America, Europe and Asia. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& The generic name ''Chrysochus'' Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 is a conserved name. It was threatened by ''Eumolpus'' in the sense used by Kugelann in Illiger, 1798, which included ''Chrysomela praetiosa'' (now a junior synonym of ''Chrysochus asclepiadeus''). An application to conserve ''Chrysochus'' and other names by suppressing ''Eumolpus'' Kugelann in Illiger, 1798 (modified to Illiger, 1798) was accepted by ICZN in 2012. &&&&& &&&&& Species &&&&& There are nine described species in ''Chrysochus''. Seven of these are from the Palearctic and Oriental realms, and two are from North America. &&&&& * ''Chrysochus asclepiadeus'' (Pallas, 1773) &&&&& ** ''Chrysochus asclepiadeus asiaeminoris'' De Monte, 1948 (Considered a synonym by Ekiz et al. (2015)) &&&&& * ''Chrysochus auratus'' (Fabricius, 1775) – Dogbane beetle &&&&& * ''Chrysochus brevefasciatus'' Pic, 1934 &&&&& * ''Chrysochus chinensis'' Baly, 1859 &&&&& * ''Chrysochus cobaltinus'' LeConte, 1857 – Blue milkweed beetle &&&&& * ''Chrysochus globicollis'' Lefèvre, 1888 &&&&& * ''Chrysochus goniostoma'' Weise, 1889 &&&&& * ''Chrysochus pulcher'' Baly, 1864 &&&&& * ''Chrysochus sikhima'' Jacoby, 1908 &&&&& &&&&& Biology &&&&& All species of ''Chryochus'' feed on plants in the Apocynaceae (dogbane) and Asclepiadaceae (milkweed) families. A small mutation has allowed the two North American species, ''C. auratus'' and ''C. cobaltinus'', in particular to feed on the plant species containing cardenolides, while all other species of the genus feed on plant species without cardenolides. &&&&& &&&&& ''C. auratus'' and ''C. cobaltinus'' have been generally considered allopatric in distribution in North America. However, two narrow regions of sympatry between the two species have been documented in western North America, one of which is located in South-central Washington. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

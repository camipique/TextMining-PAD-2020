2288	Baghdad_Derbies
Baghdad Derbies &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Baghdad Derbies''', also known as the '''Iraqi El Clásico''' matches, are a series of derby matches between four Baghdad-based football clubs: Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, Al-Shorta, Al-Talaba and Al-Zawraa, collectively known as the 'Popular Clubs'. They are the four most successful teams in the history of Iraqi football, and all league games between the clubs are played at the neutral venue of Al-Shaab Stadium to accommodate more spectators. &&&&& &&&&& Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya were the first to be founded in 1931, and Al-Shorta were founded a year later. These two sides developed a strong rivalry during the Iraqi Central League era, winning a combined eleven league titles in that time. Al-Talaba and Al-Zawraa were both founded much later in 1969, but with the foundation of the Iraqi Premier League in 1974, both teams emerged as giants of Iraqi football alongside the two older clubs forming a four-way rivalry in the capital city. None of the four teams have ever been relegated in the Premier League era. In total, the four clubs have won 30 of the 42 completed Premier League seasons, with Al-Zawraa winning a record 14, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya winning six and Al-Shorta and Al-Talaba sitting on five titles each. The four clubs also won every single edition of the Iraqi Elite Cup except for one in 1997, and have so far won every single edition of the Iraqi Super Cup too. &&&&& &&&&& In terms of continental honours, Al-Shorta reached the final of Asia's top-tier club competition, the AFC Champions League, in 1971 and are considered to be the tournament's winners by the Iraqi and Arab media after refusing to play against Israeli opposition with Israel subsequently being expelled from the AFC, whilst they also won the Arab world's top-tier club competition (the Arab Champions League) in 1982. Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya have won three second-tier continental titles, with those being the 2016, 2017 and 2018 editions of the AFC Cup, meanwhile Al-Talaba and Al-Zawraa have both never won a major continental competition, although they have both been runners-up of the Asian Cup Winners' Cup in the past. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& ===1932–1974: Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Shorta rivalry=== &&&&& The rivalry first developed between Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Shorta in the 1930s, the decade where both of the clubs were founded. They first faced off in January 1933 in the 1932–33 Prince Ghazi Cup. Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya won the match 1–0 through an own goal in the 15th minute, and went on to win the trophy that year. They also won the next two editions too, making it three cups in a row, while Al-Shorta were never able to win the trophy. The two sides went on to face each other in two cup finals that decade, the 1938 Taha Al-Hashimi Cup final and the 1939 Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya Cup final. Al-Shorta got their revenge on Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya by winning both, 1–0 and 2–0 respectively, to win their first two trophies in their history. With the foundation of the Iraqi Central League, a league for teams from central Iraq (i.e. the capital city of Baghdad), the rivalry between the clubs grew significantly. From 1956–57 until 1973–74, the two sides competed for the league title year in, year out. Both teams won five league titles in that time period and Al-Shorta reached the final of the 1971 AFC Champions League where they refused to face an Israeli team, being considered as the tournament's winners by the Iraqi and Arab media and holding an open-top bus victory parade, with Israel subsequently being expelled from the AFC. The two clubs also played some matches against national teams, with both teams defeating the China national team in 1972, and were the two best teams in the country. &&&&& &&&&& ===1974–1984: Al-Talaba and Al-Zawraa emergence=== &&&&& In August 1974, the Iraq Football Association decided to abolish the Iraqi Central League and the three other regional leagues being held at the time, replacing them with the Iraqi Premier League, a nationwide league of clubs. The very first season of the Premier League in 1974–75 was won by Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, while Al-Shorta finished in fifth. Meanwhile, the 1974–75 Iraq Division One (the second-tier of Iraqi football) was won by Al-Zawraa with Al-Talaba finishing second, thus both sides were promoted to the Premier League for the 1975–76 season. Ever since that season, the four teams have been ever-present in the Premier League and have never been relegated (Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Shorta remain the only two teams to have played in every single season of the Premier League era). &&&&& &&&&& Despite being newly-promoted, Al-Zawraa immediately became one of the best clubs in the country. This was because the runners-up of the league in the 1974–75 season, Al-Naqil, dissolved due to financial problems and all of their players joined fellow Ministry of Transport team Al-Zawraa. Thus, in their first ever season in the top-flight, Al-Zawraa won the league and also won the first edition of the FA Cup, becoming Iraq's first ever Double winners. They went on to win the league title undefeated in both the 1976–77 and 1978–79 seasons, winning the Double again in the latter campaign. Al-Shorta won the 1979–80 title and Al-Talaba were crowned champions in the 1980–81 season, meaning that after just seven seasons of the Premier League era, all four teams had already won the league title. Al-Talaba went on to retain their title, with Al-Zawraa winning a further two FA Cups and Al-Shorta becoming the first ever winners of the Arab Champions League as the four clubs continued to rack up major honours. &&&&& &&&&& ===1984–1990: Al-Rasheed temporarily join the rivalry=== &&&&& The 1984–85 season saw Al-Rasheed play in the Premier League for the first time. The club was founded a year earlier by Uday Hussein, the son of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Uday forced many of Iraq's top players to join Al-Rasheed against their will, with Al-Rasheed not only becoming one of Iraq's best clubs, but one of the best clubs in the region, winning three consecutive Arab Champions Leagues in 1985, 1986 and 1987 and losing the final of the AFC Champions League in 1989. &&&&& &&&&& As they were also based in Baghdad, the Baghdad derbies became a five-team affair. Al-Talaba won the 1985–86 title ahead of Al-Rasheed, but the next two seasons saw Al-Rasheed win the Double both times. Al-Rasheed also won the 1988–89 league ahead of Al-Talaba, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Zawraa, but Al-Zawraa were the FA Cup winners that year. The 1989–90 season saw Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya win the league and Al-Zawraa win the FA Cup, as the five derby teams continued to dominate Iraqi football. &&&&& &&&&& ===1990–2006: Four teams monopolise Iraqi football=== &&&&& Al-Rasheed were dissolved in 1990 (reportedly on the orders of Saddam Hussein) and their replacements Al-Karkh were not able to replicate Al-Rasheed's success, meaning that the Baghdad derbies returned to consisting of only four teams. The 1990s and early 2000s was the greatest era of success for the four clubs and the era where many of the most memorable derby matches were played. Between 1991 and 2006, every single edition of the Premier League, FA Cup and Super Cup was won by one of the four clubs, and only one single edition of the Elite Cup was not won by one of them. Al-Zawraa were the most successful team of this era, winning eight league titles, eight FA Cups, three Elite Cups and three Super Cups. Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya won three leagues, two FA Cups, three Elite Cups and two Super Cups, while Al-Talaba won two leagues, two FA Cups, three Elite Cups and one Super Cup and Al-Shorta won two leagues and three Elite Cups. &&&&& &&&&& Al-Talaba and Al-Zawraa also made their first ever continental final appearances. Al-Talaba reached the final of the 1995 Asian Cup Winners' Cup and Al-Zawraa reached the final of the 1999–2000 edition of the same tournament, but both sides tasted defeat to Japanese clubs and they have since both failed to reach another continental final. &&&&& &&&&& ===2006–2012: Northern clubs outperform Baghdad rivals=== &&&&& The 2006–07 Iraqi Premier League made history as Erbil became the first team from outside of Baghdad to win the league since the 1982–83 season. Erbil also won the league the next two seasons as well, becoming the first team from outside Baghdad in history to win three league titles in a row. The 2008–09 was the biggest testimony to the shift in power in Iraqi football as none of the four Baghdad rivals finished in the top four places of the league. This remains the only time in history that this has occurred. The trend continued in the 2009–10 season as a different Northern team became champions, this time Duhok. Al-Zawraa briefly brought the title back to Baghdad by winning the 2010–11 title but the Northern teams were back to dominating in the 2011–12 season as Erbil stormed to the title with only one defeat in 38 games with Duhok finishing as runners-up. &&&&& &&&&& The reason for the rise of the Northern sides was because Baghdad became more dangerous after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and thus the top players preferred to move to the safer north of the country where they would also be able to make more money. Thus, while the Baghdad derbies were still the most well-attended games and the Baghdad teams remained top clubs in the country, the significance of the derbies was somewhat diminished with the Northern clubs winning the league almost every season for half a decade. Al-Shorta and Al-Talaba even fell as far as almost being relegated, with Al-Shorta surviving relegation on goal difference in the 2010–11 season and Al-Talaba finishing just one point above the drop zone in that same campaign. &&&&& &&&&& ===2012–present: Baghdad Derbies return to the forefront=== &&&&& The dominance of the Northern clubs was ended in the 2012–13 season when Al-Shorta surprisingly won the league title only two years after nearly being relegated. Al-Shorta retained their league title in the 2013–14 season, with Al-Zawraa and Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya both winning titles in the following years. The Iraq FA Cup and Iraqi Super Cup have both returned since the 2015–16 season with Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Zawraa claiming titles in both competitions. The two most prominent Northern clubs, Erbil and Duhok, both fell into severe financial difficulty; Duhok had to withdraw from the 2015–16 Iraqi Premier League and Erbil had to withdraw from the 2016–17 Iraqi Premier League, meaning both teams were relegated to the Iraq Division One, the country's second-tier. Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya also won Asia's second-tier club competition (the AFC Cup) in 2016, 2017 and 2018, meaning that Al-Zawraa and Al-Talaba remain the only two out of the four to have zero major continental titles. &&&&& &&&&& Results &&&&& === Iraqi Premier League === &&&&& ==== Head-to-head ==== &&&&& The below statistics only include matches from the Iraqi Premier League (1974–present),

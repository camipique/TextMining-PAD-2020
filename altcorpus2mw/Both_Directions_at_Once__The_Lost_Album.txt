Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album''''' is a studio album recorded by saxophonist John Coltrane for Impulse! Records that was first released in 2018. The recordings were made in 1963 during Coltrane's Classic Quartet period and lost for decades. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& ''Both Directions at Once'' was recorded in Van Gelder Studio in New Jersey on March 6, 1963, by saxophonist John Coltrane and his Quartet: double bassist Jimmy Garrison, drummer Elvin Jones, and pianist McCoy Tyner. &&&&& &&&&& To cut down on storage space, Impulse Records destroyed the master tape, and the recording was lost for decades. The seven tracks on ''Both Directions'' survived as a copy Coltrane gave to his first wife, Juanita Naima. Van Gelder made a separate copy for Coltrane to listen to at home. In 2005, after the Guernsey's auction house announced plans to sell Coltrane-related artefacts, the record company intervened to acquire the tapes. Coltrane's son Ravi and studio executive Ken Druker assembled the final album with liner notes written by Ashley Kahn. &&&&& &&&&& The standard edition of the album includes one recording of each track and expanded deluxe editions include multiple takes, including several of the title track from ''Impressions''. All tracks were previously unreleased except for "Vilia" (Take 5), which was included in the 1965 sampler ''The Definitive Jazz Scene, Vol. 3'' and the CD reissue of ''Live at Birdland''. &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& :'''Disc one''' &&&&& #"Untitled Original 11383" (Take 1) &&&&& #"Nature Boy" &&&&& #"Untitled Original 11386" (Take 1) &&&&& #"Vilia" (Take 3) (based on Franz Lehár's "Vilja Song" from ''The Merry Widow'') &&&&& #"Impressions" (Take 3) &&&&& #"Slow Blues" &&&&& #"One Up, One Down" (Take 1) &&&&& &&&&& :'''Disc two''' &&&&& #"Vilia" (Take 5) &&&&& #"Impressions" (Take 1) &&&&& #"Impressions" (Take 2) &&&&& #"Impressions" (Take 4) – 3:40 &&&&& #"Untitled Original 11386" (Take 2) &&&&& #"Untitled Original 11386" (Take 5) &&&&& #"One Up, One Down" (Take 6) &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& :The John Coltrane Quartet &&&&& *John Coltrane – bandleader, composition, tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone &&&&& *Jimmy Garrison – double bass &&&&& *Elvin Jones – drums &&&&& *McCoy Tyner – piano &&&&& &&&&& :Additional personnel &&&&& *Ravi Coltrane – compiler &&&&& *Ken Druker – compiler &&&&& *Rudy Van Gelder – mixing &&&&& *Ashley Kahn – liner notes &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Italian Albums (FIMI) &&&&& &&&&& 18 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) &&&&& &&&&& 5 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

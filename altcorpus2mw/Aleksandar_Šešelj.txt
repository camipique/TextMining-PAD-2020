Aleksandar Šešelj &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Aleksandar Šešelj''' () is a politician in Serbia. He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2017 as a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party. Šešelj is the son of Radical Party leader Vojislav Šešelj. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and career &&&&& Šešelj was born in Belgrade, Serbia, then part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He is a student at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Šešelj received the twenty-fifth position on the Radical Party's electoral list for the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election. The list did not cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the National Assembly. He received the same position in the 2016 parliamentary election and, as the list won twenty-two mandates, was not initially elected. He also received the lead position on the Radical Party's list for the Zemun municipal assembly in the 2016 local elections, which were held concurrently with the parliamentary election. The party won nine seats out of fifty-seven and formed a local coalition government with the Serbian Progressive Party, although the parties are rivals at the republic level. Šešelj was appointed to the Zemun municipal council (i.e., the executive branch of the municipal government) in June 2016. &&&&& &&&&& Šešelj took part in a youth delegation to China in November 2016, describing China as a "true and sincere friend" of Serbia. He also participated in a Radical Party delegation to Crimea in March 2017 to mark the three-year anniversary of the area's ''de facto'' joining of the Russian Federation. The government of Ukraine, which considers Crimea to be a part of its territory, issued a five-year travel ban to Šešelj and other members of the delegation; he responded sarcastically that it "would be a shame if no sanctions were imposed" and that the delegates were "not afraid of these sanctions." During this time, he served on the presidency of the Radical Party. &&&&& &&&&& Šešelj received a mandate in the National Assembly on 25 September 2017 as a replacement for Milovan Bojić, who had resigned. Šešelj is currently a member of the assembly's Health and Family Committee and a deputy member of the environmental protection committee. He also became a member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on 24 November 2017, again as a replacement for Bojić, and is a member of the PACE committee on social affairs, health, and sustainable development and an alternate member of the committee on culture, science, education, and media. &&&&& &&&&& He was the deputy head of Miljan Damjanović's election staff in the latter's bid for mayor of Belgrade in the 2018 city election. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

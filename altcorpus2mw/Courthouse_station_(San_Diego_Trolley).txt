Courthouse station (San Diego Trolley) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Courthouse''' is a light rail station in San Diego, California, United States. It is the terminus of the San Diego Trolley's Orange Line and is located adjacent to the new San Diego Central Courthouse in Downtown San Diego, on C Street between State and Union streets. The station opened on April 29, 2018, after nearly a year of construction, replacing America Plaza station as the Orange Line's western terminus. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& After construction of the new San Diego Central Courthouse began in 2013, the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) approved plans to build a new light rail station to serve the building. The new station was also intended to become the terminus of the Orange Line, replacing the overcrowded America Plaza station near the Santa Fe Depot, which also serves the Blue Line. &&&&& &&&&& The station's location, directly in front of the courthouse, was opposed by county court officials and the sheriff due to potential security risks and disruptions to court operations. The MTS declined to move the station, but cooperated with the court to add shared CCTV and security features. &&&&& &&&&& MTS received a $31.9 million grant from the state government's cap and trade program in 2015 to fund the Courthouse station project and a vehicle replacement program. Construction on the station began in August 2017, requiring multiple weekend shutdowns of the Orange Line. Courthouse station was dedicated by local officials on April 27, 2018, and opened to passengers on April 29; it is the first new station on the trolley system since 2005. &&&&& &&&&& Station layout &&&&& Orange Line trains at Courthouse station use a single track leading to a side platform, while Blue and Silver line trains use two bypass tracks. &&&&& &&&&& Courthouse station features enhanced lighting, security cameras, and standard station features like ticket vending machines, digital signs, shelters, and benches. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Platform''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Eastbound''' &&&&& &&&&& → '''Orange Line''' toward Arnele Avenue (Civic Center) → &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Side platform, doors will open on the right &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

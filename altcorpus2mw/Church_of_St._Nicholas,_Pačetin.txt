Some icons show the elements of Secession with the icon of the Virgin's on the top of the iconostasis having the most elements of Secession. Old iconostasis from the 1891 was painted by Đorđe Rakić from Neština.

In early 2000's church attracted attention among Orthodox and some Catholic believers when story about weeping icon of Saint Nicholas appeared in regional and national media. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Eparchy of Osječko polje and Baranja &&&&& *Pačetin &&&&& *Serbs of Croatia &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

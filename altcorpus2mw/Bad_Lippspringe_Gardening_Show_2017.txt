Bad Lippspringe Gardening Show 2017 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The horticultural show '''Bad Lippspringe 2017''' was the 17th State Garden Show of North Rhine-Westphalia. On June 1, 2011 the city of Bad Lippspringe was chosen out of five applications by the NRW Ministry of the Environment. &&&&&  &&&&& The garden show took place from April 12 to October 15, 2017. The motto of the show was "Floral splendor & Forest idyll".This was also the first garden show in North Rhine-Westphalia to take place with the forest as backdrop. The town of Bad Lippspringe is the smallest town to date to receive the finance to host the Landesgartenschau NRW. The exhibition was located in the forest and in the Arminiuspark, which are connected to the city centre by a boulevard. Flower shows and theme gardens were the main attractions. &&&&& The horticultural show consisted of two areas: One being the area north of the city, which comprised the Kaiser Karl Park and the Kurwald (a section of the forest) with a surface area of about 30 ha, and the second being the Arminiuspark (3 ha) within the city in the immediate vicinity of the source of the Lippe. During the period of the garden show the Arminiuspark was partially fenced off. &&&&& &&&&& Application procedure &&&&& Kaiser-Karls-Park before its conversion to the garden show &&&&& &&&&& In 2006 the North Rhine-Westphalian state government decided that the state garden shows would take place every three years between 2008 and 2017. By January 31, 2011 five candidates had submitted their applications to the Ministry of the Environment for the 2017 show. &&&&& &&&&& The following cities and municipalities applied to organize the State Garden Show 2017: &&&&& &&&&& Ahlen (district of Warendorf): Their slogan was "Ahlen in the Trialogue", which refers to an approximately eleven kilometer-circular-route, which was planned to be in the center of the State Garden Show. The connection between the various areas of the horticultural show was to be an existing cycle path on the Werse, the former railway line of the Westphalia mine, and the path along the Olfe. The decommissioned Westfalen mine was to form the core area and include, among other things, the display areas. A mining waste heap east of the colliery was to be turned into an adventure area. &&&&& &&&&& Bad Lippspringe (district of Paderborn): The feasibility study included plans to upgrade the Kaiser-Karl Park and make the adjacent park forest more fun. The horticultural elements of the show were to be displayed in the park and on the Schützen square. In addition, the city center as well as the Arminius and Jordan Parks were to be integrated with a roundwalk. In the application, this area was also intended for other events. Along the tour, so-called health gardens were planned to give incentives to exercise in the open. &&&&& &&&&& Soest, Bad Sassendorf, Möhnesee (district of Soest): Three core areas were planned, which should be connected by a garden show route. Along this route all facets of Westphalia were to be presented. In addition, the historic town centre of Soest was to be integrated and connected to the exhibition areas in Bad Sassendorf through the Wiesenpark (formerly a railway line) a continuation of the existing city park.There, the Haulle Park with its historic buildings, the city center and the adjacent spa park were to be made more attractive. In Möhnesee the main town Körbecke was to be better connected to the reservoir and include a park with a lake. &&&&& &&&&& Vreden (district of Borken): The application focused on the area around the river Berkel. Berkel lake was to be redesigned as the southernmost core area. After the demolition of the local industrial buildings on the island of Berkel, the construction of urban gardens was planned. Areas for the cultural history center, Westmünsterland, and the hydroelectric power station were to be built at the harbour. It was also planned to integrate the Hamaland Museum and the already existing city park. The junction of the exhibition areas on energy and the sculpture park west of this area were to follow. The bordering school campus was also part of the gardening show’s concept. &&&&& &&&&& Warendorf (district of Warendorf): The Landesgartenschau was to located in the area between the historic city centre and the Emsseepark. Consequently, the Wilhelmsplatz in the city centre was to be redesigned and the connection to the northern districts and to the North Rhine-Westphalian horse breeding farm Warendorf was to be improved. A more attractive design of an industrial plant between the historic city centre and the Emssee was planned, as well as the integration of the already existing Sophienpark. The Emssepark was to be modernized and almost completely redesigned. &&&&& &&&&& After visiting the individual candidate cities, a ten-member assessment committee chose Bad Lippspringe as the venue for the garden show 2017 on 1 June 2011. &&&&& &&&&& Venue &&&&& view to Mersmann ponds, area of the garden show &&&&& Arminiuspark during the garden show &&&&& &&&&& Bad Lippspringe was the first place to hold a garden show in a forest setting. True to the motto "Blumenpracht & Waldidylle" ("Floral splendor & Forest idyll") there were flower shows, themed gardens and events between the parks and the city centre. &&&&& &&&&& The city of Bad Lippspringe was first mentioned in a document in 780 in the imperial annals of Charlemagne. Several imperial assemblies took place at the source of the Lippe, the longest river in North Rhine-Westphalia. Bad Lippspringe received its town charter in 1445, but today’s municipal law was passed in 1921. With the discovery of the Arminius spring in 1832, the towns became spa resorts. ''Bad Lippspringe is the only place in North Rhine-Westphalia which manages climatic health resorts and therapeutic baths.'' &&&&& &&&&& The preliminary studies for the founding of the Bad Lippspringe gardening show 2017 began in June 2009. Feasibility studies started in September 2010, the application was made in January 2011. Bad Lippspringe competed with other better known spa towns and ultimately got the financial support in June 2011. The first steps on the way to the gardening show were the decisions on the mascot "Lippolino" in May 2012 and on the logo in January 2013. Following the competition of landscape architects which took place from April to November 2013, construction work started in February 2014. &&&&& &&&&& The gardening show hoped to achieve sustainable outcomes. Accordingly, Bad Lippspringe received further grants, amongst others from the urban development promotion programme, up to the year 2017. The city targeted day trippers, spa visitors and locals equally. &&&&& &&&&& Friends of Bad Lippspringe &&&&& In January 2012, the friends of Landesgartenschau Bad Lippspringe 2017 e.V. was founded under the motto “Wir sind Landesgartenschau!” ("We are the garden show!") The playground on the venue was financed by the members. The association attached great importance to a sustainable use of the national gardening show facilities. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

He was described as the "right-hand man" of Chihuahua governor César Duarte during his time in office. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Hermosillo Arteaga was born in Hidalgo del Parral and obtained his degree in business administration from the Instituto Tecnológico de Parral in 2001.

Some of the homes were registered in the name of his wife, Mayra Julieta Urbina Arzola. In December 2016, he appeared before a judge in a legal case against him for unlawful enrichment; the judge ordered the case reopened after the Duarte government closed it in its final week.

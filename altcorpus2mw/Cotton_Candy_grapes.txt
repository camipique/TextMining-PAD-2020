Cotton Candy grapes &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Cotton Candy grapes''' are a variety of grapes produced in California by Grapery, which became available for consumers to buy in 2011. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& Grapery was founded by Jack Pandol and is owned by him and Jim Beagle. At International Fruit Genetics, fruit geneticist David Cain developed their patented Cotton Candy grapes and other varieties by using hand-pollination to cross pollinate millions of grapes to develop the desirable varieties. &&&&& &&&&& Experiments were done to try to combine concord grapes, known for their flavor, with Vitis vinifera in order to make them firm. A hundred thousand plants were created and grown in test tubes before developing this variety of grape. Development took 12 years. &&&&& &&&&& No artificial flavoring is added to give this variety of grapes a flavor similar to cotton candy. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official website &&&&& * Patent information &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

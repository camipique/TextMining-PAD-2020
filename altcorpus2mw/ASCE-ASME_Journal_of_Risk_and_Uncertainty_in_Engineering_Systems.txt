ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) - American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part A: Civil Engineering and Part B: Mechanical Engineering''' is a scientific journal established in 2014. It disseminates research findings, best practices concerns, and discussions and debates on risk- and uncertainty-related issues in the areas of civil and mechanical engineering and other related fields. &&&&& &&&&& Scope &&&&& The journal covers risk and uncertainty issues in planning, design, construction/manufacturing, utilization, decommissioning and removal, and evaluation of engineering systems. The journal has wide coverage to all sub-disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering and other related fields, including structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resources engineering, construction engineering, transport engineering, coastal engineering, nuclear engineering, industrial and manufacturing engineering including gas, oil and chemical, ocean engineering, hazard analysis including climate change, earthquake engineering, associated resilience and sustainability, mechanics, mechatronics, robotics, thermodynamics, human factors, and thermo science. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Professor Bilal M. Ayyub from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland College Park, established the ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems in 2014 in coordination and consultation with an advisory board representing leaders from ASCE and ASME. As of 2018, it is the only joint journal for both societies with another society in their respective long histories. ASCE and ASME registered the two parts as separate journals as Part A and Part B, respectively, to facilitate the production of the journal along other journals offered by the respective societies. Both journals have the same editorial board and leadership and produced their first quarterly issues at the end of first quarter of 2015. The founding and current Editor-in-Chief of the two journals is Professor Ayyub. &&&&& &&&&& Indexes &&&&& Both Part A and Part B are listed in the Emerging Sources Citation Index by Clarivate Analytics, formerly Thomson Reuters, and it is eligible for indexing in 2018. From 2016 onward, all articles are included in Web of Science. They are included also in Scopus. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Chris Byrd vs. Wladimir Klitschko &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Chris Byrd vs. Wladimir Klitschko''', billed as '''Die Rache des Bruders''' (German for "Revenge Of The Brother"), was a professional boxing match contested on 14 October 2000 for the WBO Heavyweight Championship. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& After his shock victory over the undefeated Vitali Klitschko, following Vitali suffering a torn rotator cuff, Chris Byrd agreed to face his number one contender, and Vitali's younger brother Wladimir. Wladimir Klitschko had won ten fights in a row following his first pro loss at the hands of journeyman Ross Puritty in December 1998. &&&&& &&&&& The fight &&&&& Klitschko knocked Byrd down in round nine and again in round eleven on route to a clear unanimous decision victory with scores of 120-106, 119-107 & 118-108, giving him his first world title belt. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& Wladimir would go on to make six defences of his title before he suffered a knockout loss to Corrie Sanders in March 2003. Byrd would win his next four bouts, including against Maurice Harris and David Tua in an IBF heavyweight title "eliminator" mini-tournament which put him in line for a shot at the IBF belt then held by Lennox Lewis. Lewis would vacate the title and Byrd would face former champion Evander Holyfield for the vacant belt. &&&&& &&&&& Undercard &&&&& Confirmed bouts: &&&&& &&&&& Broadcasting &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Country &&&&& &&&&& Broadcaster &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  Sat.1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  Sky Box Office &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Adriatica Ionica Race &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Adriatica Ionica Race''' is an Italian annual professional men's road bicycle race introduced in the 2018 season as a part of the UCI Europe Tour, and currently classified as a 2.1 event. The race is organised by former professional cyclist Moreno Argentin and ASD Sport Union. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The race was founded by Argentin together with Quanto Basta, with its first edition taking place in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Although the name of the race suggest the race being run between the coasts of the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea (similarly to how Terreni-Adriatico is run between the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic coasts), the first edition was ran entirely within two mountainous Italian regions bordering the Terrenian sea, namely Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Race director Mario Argentin has however stated his plans being to within five years expand the race to a ten-day race starting at the Adriatic coast, passing through Austria, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania and finally finishing in Athens, Greece. &&&&& &&&&& The race will return with its second edition In 2019, and will be held between June 23 and June 28. &&&&& &&&&& Winners &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

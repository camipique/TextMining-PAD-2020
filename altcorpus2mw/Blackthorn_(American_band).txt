393	Blackthorn_(American_band)
Blackthorn (American band) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Blackthorn''' is an American rock band formed in Pennsylvania in 1993. Their style of music has come to be called Celtic Rock for the fusion of Irish traditional instruments and music with modern rock. They have released five albums, starting with ''It's an Irish Thing'' in 1993 and most recently ''Push & Pull'' in 2006. Their repertoire consists mostly of original rock compositions and Irish folk songs with a rock twist. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Mike and John Boyce are the son of Barney Boyce, an Irish immigrant from County Donegal and U.S. Army veteran. Accordion player John McGroary is the only band member who was born in Ireland. Paul Moore, a founding member, played acoustic guitar and lead vocals. He was considered the face of Blackthorn by most of the fan base. Blackthorm was formed in 1993 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, with influences from the Clancy Brothers and the Dubliners. Their first album, "It's an Irish Thing", and the song "Celtic Symphony" became a hit in the Philadelphia area in 1994. The band added Seamus Kelleher on guitar in 1995. Their second album ''Here We Go Again'' featured more of a rock feel owing to Kelleher's influence. "The Other Side", their third album, got major airplay on the East Coast and was the first with entirely original compositions. Singer Mike Boyce, younger brother of John Boyce, joined in 2002. &&&&& &&&&& In 2011, Seamus Kelleher left the band to pursue a solo career. He had been suffering from health problems ever since falling down a flight of stairs at a King of Prussia bar. Kelleher still makes guest appearances with the band on occasion. Rob Dunleavy replaced him on lead guitar. They were the headlining band at the 2012 Haverford Music Festival. Blackthorn has frequently played at the Rose Tree Park festival. They performed at the Inaugural Cheesesteak Fest in 2015. &&&&& &&&&& Members &&&&& ===Current=== &&&&& *Rob Dunleavy – guitar and vocals &&&&& *Mike Boyce – bass and vocals &&&&& *John McGroary – accordion &&&&& *John Boyce – keyboard and vocals &&&&& *Mike O'Callaghan – drums and percussion &&&&& &&&&& ===Former=== &&&&& *Seamus Kelleher – lead guitar &&&&& *Paul Moore - guitar, lead vocals, founding member &&&&& &&&&& Discography &&&&& * ''It's an Irish Thing'' (1994) &&&&& * ''Here We Go Again'' (1996) &&&&& * ''The Other Side'' (1998) &&&&& * ''Ratty Shoes'' (2001) &&&&& * ''Push & Pull'' (2006) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Allmusic &&&&& * Blackthorn - Dara Records &&&&& * Cops: Teacher locks son in car at bar to watch band &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

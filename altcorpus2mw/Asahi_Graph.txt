Asahi Graph &&&&& Introduction &&&&& ''Asahi Graph'' September 1937: Japanese troops in North China &&&&& March 1951: Michiyo Kogure &&&&& , also known as '''''The Asahi Picture News''''', was a Japanese weekly pictorial magazine that ran from 1923 until 2000. &&&&& &&&&& ''Asahi Graph'' started on 25 January 1923 as a daily feature from Asahi Shinbunsha (publisher of ''Asahi Shinbun'' and soon also of Asahi Camera); this ran until 1 September 1923 when it was stopped by the major earthquake in Tokyo. It was back as a weekly from 14 November. In 1926 it was joined by ''Asahi Graphic'' (朝日グラフィック) which the Osaka branch of Asahi Shinbunsha had been publishing since 2 January 1921. &&&&& &&&&& ''Asahi Graph'' survived World War II and reemerged as something of a Japanese equivalent of the US magazine ''Life''. (''Mainichi Graph'', from Asahi's rival Mainichi Shinbunsha, was similar.) The last regular issue of the magazine is dated 13 October 2000. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *Shirayama Mari.

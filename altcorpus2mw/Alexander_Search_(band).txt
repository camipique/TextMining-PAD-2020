Alexander Search (band) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Alexander Search''' is an English language Portuguese Indie Pop / Indie Rock band, formed in Lisbon, Portugal, by pianist Júlio Resende and singer Salvador Sobral in late-2016.  &&&&& &&&&& "Alexander Search" was one of the many heteronyms used by 20th Century Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa. Search, a literary persona/pseudonym created by the author during his teenage years, wrote mainly in English (Pessoa would later switch to writing exclusively in his native Portuguese language). &&&&& &&&&& The band pays tribute to the work of Fernando Pessoa by adopting his pseudonym's name and playing original indie pop/rock songs built around his poetry. Also in the same spirit, each of the band's members adopted pseudonyms. &&&&& &&&&& Alexander Search's self-titled debut album was released in June 2017, peaking at number 3 in the Portuguese charts . &&&&& &&&&& Members &&&&& Salvador Sobral, "Benjamin Cymbra" - Vocals (2016-present) &&&&& Júlio Resende, "Augustus Search" - Keyboards, Piano (2016-present) &&&&& Daniel Neto, "Marvel K." - Electric Guitar (2016-present) &&&&& André Nascimento, "Sgt.

Chinook Observer &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Chinook Observer''' is a weekly newspaper serving the Long Beach Peninsula of Washington state. It is named after Chinook, Washington, where the paper was founded in 1900 by George Hibbert and Frank Gaither. &&&&& &&&&& Hibbert sold the paper to John and Margaret Durkee in about 1923, who sold it to Bill Clancey in 1933, adding James O'Neil as a co-owner in 1937. O'Neil moved the paper to Long Beach, Washington in 1938. The paper was purchased by Craig and Geri Dennis in 1984, then purchased in 1988 by the East Oregonian Publishing Company, now called the EO Media Group and printed at The Daily Astorian. Matt Winters became the paper's editor in 1992, and remained in that position as of 2011. &&&&& &&&&& In 2015, the paper received a warning from the United States Postal Service about the legality of advertisements for marijuana-related products and services. Recreational use of marijuana, though still illegal at the federal level, had recently been legalized in Washington and the neighboring state of Oregon. &&&&& &&&&& In July 2016, David Pero became the publisher of the EO Media Group's north coast papers, including the ''Observer'' and several publications in northwest Oregon. He succeeded Steve Forrester, a member of the family that owns the EO Media Group, who served as publisher for 28 years. In 2017 Kari Borgen succeeded Pero in that role. &&&&& &&&&& As of 2018 the paper's circulation was 6700. &&&&& &&&&& The original Linotype machine, a Mergenthaler, was taken out of service in the 1970s and is on loan to the Columbia Pacific Heritage Museum in Ilwaco, Washington. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * History of Chinook, George Hibbert, Pacific County Historical Society, 1979 &&&&& * Library of Congress "Chronicling America" entry &&&&& * Several items in '' The Washington Newspaper'', Vol. 7 (1921) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

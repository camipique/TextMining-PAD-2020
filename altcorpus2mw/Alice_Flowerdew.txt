Alice Flowerdew &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Alice Flowerdew''' (sometimes erroneously called Anne; 1759 – 23 September 1830) was a British teacher, religious poet, and hymnwriter. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& Alice Flowerdew was born in 1759, in Bury St. Edmunds, England. Her maiden name has not been ascertained. She is erroneously referred to as "Anne" by Sir Roundell Palmer and other authorities. A living descendant subsequently corrected the name. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& She was the second wife of Daniel Flowerdew, who for a few years held a Government appointment in Jamaica. After he resigned his customs position in Jamaica and requested other employment, they returned to England at the end of the 19th-century. &&&&& &&&&& After the husband's death in 1801, his widow kept a ladies' boarding school at Islington. It was while there that she wrote the most of her poetical pieces. During her residence at Islington, she attended the ministry of the Rev. Dr. John Evans, the author of ''A Sketch of the Several Religious Denominations'' (1795), and of some other works. Evans was the minister of the General Baptists Church, Worship Street, London, and a Arian, and Flowerdew is said to have held the same views. &&&&& &&&&& Subsequently, she removed to Bury St. Edmunds, and while there, she became a member of Bury St. Edmunds' "Glasshouse" congregation. In 1802, her stepson, Charles Frederic Flowerdew, died. In 1803, she published by subscription, in 1803, a duodecimo volume, entitled ''Poems on Moral and Religious Subjects''. It was sold by her friend, Henry Delahoy Symonds, and by Martha Gurney. &&&&& &&&&& In the preface to her work, dated 24 May 1803, she says they were:—"written at different periods of life—some indeed at a very early age, and others under the very severe pressure of misfortune, when my pen had frequently given that relief which could not be derived from other employments." This work reached a second edition in 1804. &&&&& &&&&& Her volume reached a third edition in 1811, and in that edition appeared her well-known harvest hymn, "Fountain of mercy, God of love". This hymn, sometimes attributed to John Needham, was probably altered from a hymn by Needham (1768). It is believed, by a relative of Flowerdew, to have been written prior to 1810. It first appeared in 1811, in the third edition of ''Poems on Moral and Religious Subjects''. It is not found in the first edition of that work in 1803. By comparing it with Needham's hymns, it will be seen to be superior, especially in form. Relatives and friends of the family are fully agreed in ascribing it to Flowerdew. She wrote other pieces afterwards, but her later poems were not published in a collected form. &&&&& &&&&& Flowerdew eventually moved to Ipswich. She died in Whitton on 23 September 1830. She was buried in the churchyard of Whitton, distant a few miles from Ipswich. The inscription from her tomb reads:—"Sacred to the memory of Mrs. Alice Flowerdew, who died September 23, 1830, aged 71 years." She was survived by a grandson, J. D. McKenzie, of St. Albans. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Attribution=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& ===Bibliography=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

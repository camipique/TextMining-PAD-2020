Casa del Labrador &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Casa del Labrador''' is a neoclassical palace in Aranjuez, Spain. The name means "house of the farm labourer", although it was intended for royal use. A relatively small building, it was designed to complement the Royal Palace, providing a place for the royal family to spend the day without some of the customary restrictions of court life. &&&&& &&&&& Architecture &&&&& The initial design was by the royal architect, Juan de Villanueva for King Charles IV. &&&&& Detail of facade &&&&& A cartouche on the facade gives the date as 1803. &&&&& The work was completed by Isidro González Velázquez. &&&&& &&&&& Decorations &&&&& The French designer Jean-Démosthène Dugourc, who entered Charles IV's service after the French Revolution broke out, made an important contribution to the interior decorations. &&&&&  &&&&& The marble floors incorporate some Roman mosaics found in Merida. &&&&& There are murals by Zacarías González Velázquez. &&&&& &&&&& Access and conservation &&&&& The Casa del Labrador is set in gardens called the Jardín del Príncipe bordering the River Tagus. &&&&& The gardens have been designated a ''Jardín Histórico'' and access is free of charge. There is a charge to visit the building, which is in the care of Patrimonio Nacional. &&&&& &&&&& In 1993 the building was listed on the Spanish heritage register as a ''Bien de Interés Cultural'' under the name "Casita del Labrador".

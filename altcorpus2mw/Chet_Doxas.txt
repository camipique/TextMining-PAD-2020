Chet Doxas &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Chet Doxas''' is a jazz soloist and saxophonist whose album Rich in Symbols was nominated for a Juno award in 2018 for Best Jazz Solo Album of the year. He is originally from Montreal, Quebec. &&&&& &&&&& Life and career &&&&& &&&&& Doxas was born to parents whom were teachers. In his youth, he was in a swing jazz ensemble which performed around Montreal. He later attended McGill University where he would perform his music. After not finding any career growth in Montreal, he moved to New York City to further his career. &&&&& &&&&& After non-award-winning albums (including Big Sky and Dive, which he recorded before moving to New York), Doxas had a breakthrough with his Rich in Symbols album which in 2018 was nominated for a Juno award for Best Jazz solo album of the year. Rich in Symbols is different than most jazz albums due to a more rock world studio approach. The album features guitar work on select tracks by Dave Nugent. Doxas has also been a member of the Sam Roberts Band where he would play the woodwind instrument. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

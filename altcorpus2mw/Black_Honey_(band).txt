Black Honey (band) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Black Honey''' is a British four-piece indie rock band formed in Brighton, England in 2014. The band is composed of lead singer and guitarist Izzy Baxter Phillips, guitarist Chris Ostler, bassist Tommy Taylor, and drummer Tom Dewhurst. The band released an eponymous debut EP in late 2014 followed by a series of singles, creating a buzz ever since 2015. &&&&& &&&&& In early incarnations, Black Honey were partly defined by their signature guitar sound which evokes spaghetti westerns, Tarantino movies and Twin Peaks type connotations. Although this sound continues to be present in the latest material, the band's repertoire in this aspect has expanded since perhaps the middle of 2017. The other signature aspect of the sound is Izzy Phillip's distinctive singing voice. &&&&& Through 2014 to 2017, Black Honey's output consisted of the regular release of Singles and EP's. The EP "Black Honey" was released in 2014, and the EP "Headspin" in 2016. One of the characteristics of these releases was the vinyl format, featuring ambitious artwork, which remains an emblematic element of a Black Honey "hard copy". &&&&& &&&&& The self titled debut album was released on 21 September 2018, it reached number 33 in the UK album chart. A good performance for a band not supported by a major label. The album is wide ranging in its genre and by no means a predictable rock album, borrowing from pop and hip-hop. With this album, the band have clearly pursued a more ambitious objective than previously. At one point on the record a full orchestra is employed to create an expansive sound. &&&&& &&&&& The musicians are known as being protective of their creative control. The band members are directly involved in all aspects of music production and also video production in collaboration with chosen directors/producers. The band are also involved with other artistic content such as fashion, publicity and album art. Black Honey have recently begun to introduce keyboard and synth sounds into their music, in addition to some stylized vocal manipulation - although their basic preferred sound is analogue. &&&&& &&&&& =History= &&&&& 2014 &&&&& A single with the songs Sleep Forever and Teenager released during early 2014. &&&&& A second Black Honey single: Bloodlust was released in October of 2014 &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& * Tour dates: 19/01/2015 Lexington | 20/01/2015 The Old Blue Last | 03/02/2015 Red Rooms Nottingham | &&&&& * Tour dates: 08/04/15 Birmingham - supporting Superfood 09/04/15 London - supporting Superfood 25/05/15 Focus Wales Festival 02/05/15 Live at Leeds 03/05/15 Live at Glasgow 14/05/15 - 16/05/15 The Great Escape Festival 30/05/15 Wychwood Festival 22/07/15 Croatia Rocks 24/07/15 Secret Garden Party 31/07/15 2000 Trees - July 2015 Y Not Festival 01/08/15 Standon Calling 02/08/15 Kendal Calling Sunflower Lounge Birmingham, Sunday 18TH October 2015 &&&&& * Black Honey generated a lot of interest in the media during 2015. &&&&& * Black Honey single Spinning Wheel &&&&& * Black Honey single Madonna. &&&&& * Black Honey were invited to do a prestigious BBC radio 1 Session for Huw Stephens. &&&&& * Black Honey got a break supporting Superfood at The Rainbow Warehouse Birmingham on Wed 8 April 2015 &&&&& &&&&& 2016 &&&&& * UK Tour took place. &&&&& * Black Honey generated a lot of interest in newspapers and in the blogspace during 2016. &&&&& * Black Honey were invited to support Catfish And The Bottlemen on their UK tour. &&&&& * Headspin EP release. &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& * UK Tour &&&&& * NPO 3FM Festival - Netherlands &&&&& * Black Honey generated plenty of interest in the media worldwide during 2017. &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& * Black Honey Touring the UK in 2018: | The Rodeo 16 March 2018 | 09/05 Welly Club, Hull | 10/05 Sugarmill, Stoke | 11/05 The Leadmill, Sheffield | 13/05 The Globe, Cardiff | 14/05 O2 Academy 2, Oxford | 15/05 Wedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth &&&&& * Black Honey were featuring in many newspaper and blogspace interviews during 2018. &&&&& * Black Honey released their first album during 2018. &&&&& * Black Honey embarked on an autumn tour around the UK in 2018 to promote their debut album. &&&&& * Black Honey went on a european headline tour later in 2018: Friday November the 2nd, Le Botanique Saint-Josse-Ten-Noode, Belgium | Saturday November the 3rd, Bitterzoet, Amsterdam, Netherlands | Monday November the 5th, Molotow Skybar, Hamburg-Nord, Germany | Tuesday November the 6th Cassiopeia, Berlin, Germany | NOV 8 THU MTC Club, Koln, Germany | Friday November the 9th, LE GIBUS, Paris, France &&&&& * Black Honey released a single Crowded City, with accompanying video during November 2018. &&&&& &&&&& In 2019 &&&&& * Black Honey continue to tour during 2019.

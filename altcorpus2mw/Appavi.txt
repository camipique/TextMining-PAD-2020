661	Appavi
Appavi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Appavi''''' () is a 2011 Indian Tamil language Patriotism film directed by R. Raghuraj. The Revenge of a Comman Man is mainly based on the Anti-social elements in our society and how our country is favoring the evils instead of keeping a check on them. This ruins the lives of thousands of people. The movie tells us the story of a person who is affected by a social evil and hence takes revenge against the corrupt to make them realize the consequence of their actions. The film stars includes debutant Gautham, Suhani Kalita, K. Bhagyaraj, Soori &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Bharathi (Gautham) is a refined college goer and a gem among his peers, while in secret he is a daring vigilante who executes corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, terrorists and anyone who harms the general public. Bharathi's marks his crimes by recording his victim's confessions of wrongdoing in their mobile phones and circulating these as MMSs before executing them. A wannabe MLA with hidden wealth, a corrupt minister and a terrorist are executed on camera and their videos are circulated among the general public. The police are baffled, corrupt politicians and bureaucrats fear for their lives, while the common man celebrates the MMS killer, whose actions are an antidote for their resentment towards inefficient and corrupt government functionaries. &&&&&  &&&&& In his normal life, Bharathi tops in his academics and discipline, which makes him the heart throb of his college mates. His college mate Ramya (Suhani Kalita), daughter of a powerful politician Susa (Mahadevan), falls for him and tries to woo him, but in vain. Ramya's father Susa is so powerful that he moves ministers and bureaucrats like chess pieces, becoming the MMS killer's ultimate target. Bharathi's mother Manimeghalai(Sriranjini) is a headstrong IAS officer, who enforces her duty without bowing to political pressures. While Bharathi wages his secret war against corruption and nepotism, his mother wages the same battle, armed with the bureaucracy. &&&&&  &&&&& As the Bharathi's MMS murders increase, the fearful politicians and bureaucrats hand the case over to a sincere officer. They appoint Bharathi's mother Sriranjini as they believe her persistence will bring the MMS killer to conviction. Now begins a triangular game of action, with Bharathi hunting down corrupt politicians while they target Sriranjini for her honesty and she tries to capture the MMS killer (Bharathi.) &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& * Gautham as Bharathi &&&&& * Suhani Kalita as Ramya &&&&& * Soori as Bharthi's friend &&&&& * K. Bhagyaraj as Ramasamy (Bharathi's father) &&&&& * Sriranjini as Manimeghalai (Bharathi's mother) &&&&& * Manobala as College Professor &&&&& * Mahadevan as Susa &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& R. Raghuraj wrote the story and screenplay of ''Appavi '' and also decided to direct it with the intention of making the youth of the country realise the importance of being patriotic. "I call Appavi a patriotic film. So many films are made showing the problems India faces. Why is it that they have not suggested any solutions? My film talks about the problems and their solutions so that India can be a super power in the world," said Raghuraj. &&&&& The movie has a record for creating the longest Indian flag stretching to 1115 feet, and 500 college students held in one of its songs. The fiery patriotic song was written by Vairamuthu and composed by Joshua Sridhar &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Director R. Raghuraj's Appavi is a sincere attempt to highlight the issues that cripple the development of India. Though Raghuraj's effort is laudable, his presentation of the theme is lamentable. Appavi has held on to an overused formula in Tamil cinema while tossing reality out of the window. The movie tries to show the ill effects of anti-social elements in the society and how it affects the common man. The hero of this film is such a man who is affected by the anti social elements and tries to take revenge against them. The film eventually had a delayed release in 2011 due to its political opposition for the strong content. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

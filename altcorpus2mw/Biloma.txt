117	Biloma
Biloma &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Biloma''' is collection of bile within the abdominal cavity. It happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for removing the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), with an incidence of 0.3â€“2%. Other causes are biliary surgery, liver biopsy, abdominal trauma, and, rarely, spontaneous perforation. &&&&& &&&&& Symptoms are usually diffused or localized abdominal pain. Ascites and peritonitis are less common. Fever is often absent. Blood tests may show leukocytosis and nonspecific liver test abnormalities. &&&&& &&&&& Diagnosis is by abdominal ultrasound, MRCP, or HIDA scan. &&&&& &&&&& Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and ranges from ERCP with sphincterotomy or stent placement to surgical hepaticojejunostomy. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Biliary injury &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Bile Duct Leaks &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

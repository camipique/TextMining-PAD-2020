Chevrolet Blazer (crossover) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& :''See also Chevrolet Blazer (disambiguation)'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Chevrolet Blazer''' is a 5-seat mid-size crossover SUV produced by General Motors brand Chevrolet. The vehicle went into production in December 2018 and debuted in January 2019 as a 2019 model. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& The Blazer nameplate, whose history dates back to 1969 when it was introduced as a three door large SUV, was introduced to the public in Atlanta on June 21, 2018 as a mid-size CUV that will be slotted in between the compact Equinox and the 3-row full-size Traverse. It will serve as a counterpart to the GMC Acadia in the midsize CUV segment and will be built on the same platform as the Acadia. The vehicle’s design will detail a sporty-style look that takes its cues from the Camaro but will have a CUV feel. &&&&& &&&&& === Powertrain === &&&&& The Blazer will be powered by a standard 2.5 L I4 engine rated at and of torque. A 3.6 L V6 engine option will also be available, offering up and of torque. &&&&& &&&&& === Transmission === &&&&& The Blazer will make use of GM's 9-speed 9T50 automatic transmission. The same transmission is also used in the company's Cruze, Malibu, and Equinox models. &&&&& &&&&& === Trim levels and pricing === &&&&& The Blazer will feature both FWD and AWD, with a choice of L, Blazer (1LT, 2LT, and 3LT), RS, and Premier trim levels. It will have a starting MSRP of $29,995 (USD), including destination charge, for the base L model when it officially goes on sale in January 2019. &&&&& &&&&& Chevrolet also announced that ten colors, three exhaust styles, and seven wheel designs, will be featured for the Blazer. &&&&& &&&&& File:2019 Chevrolet Blazer RS, Cleveland Auto Show.jpg|2019 Blazer '''RS''' (rear) &&&&& File:Side view of a 2019 Blazer.jpg|Side view &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Blazer XL &&&&& GM confirmed in February 2019 that there are plans to introduce a large-size version of the Blazer to China and regional territories as '''Blazer XL''', set for the 2020 model year. The vehicle would be sold in countries where it could fill the same full-size crossover SUV slot reserved for the Traverse due to the latter's length and width. So far, in addition to China, Chevrolet is looking at Brazil and South Korea as key places, although the United States and Canada is a possibility despite the presence of the Traverse in the latter two countries. &&&&& &&&&& Production and assembly &&&&& 2019 Blazer '''Premier''' &&&&& Intended to be built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, or possibly Lordstown, Ohio, GM chose the Ramos Arizpe Assembly in Mexico instead due to its capabilities to assemble midsize vehicles and to allow the Spring Hill facilities to focus more on producing the Acadia and Cadillac XT5 because of shift hour issues. &&&&& &&&&& On November 27, 2018, Chevrolet began production on the Blazer in Ramos Arizpe, phasing out production of the discontinued Chevrolet Cruze altogether. The latter ended its North American production in March 2019.. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sales &&&&& The news and buzz surrounding the Blazer and its expectations has paid off with customers acquiring the SUV ahead of its January 2019 debut. According to GM, the first 27 units were sold in December 2018, a rarity for a soft launch among GM vehicles. At the end of first quarter 2019, it had sold 3,023 units in the United States. &&&&& &&&&& International markets &&&&& ===North America=== &&&&& Although the Blazer debuted in the United States and Canada in December 2018, the vehicle was not launched in Mexico, where the CUV is built, until mid-February 2019. This gives all three countries a complete crossover and SUV lineup, ranging from the Trax all the way up to the Suburban. The Mexican version differs from the ones built for U.S. and Canada markets, as the levels trims are Tela (replacing L), Piel (replacing Premier), and RS, exclusive to Mexico. &&&&& &&&&& ===China=== &&&&& In China, Chevrolet unveiled a counterpart concept of the Blazer, the FNR-CarryAll, and will be a larger 3-row crossover SUV, with a length of 5,000 mm (196 inches) on a wheelbase of 2,867 mm (112.87 inches), a width of 2,258 mm (88.9 inches) including mirrors and height of 1,693 mm (66.65 inches). &&&&& &&&&& ===South America=== &&&&& Chevrolet will also sell the Blazer in South American markets, with Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia (where they expect to modify their roster) receiving the vehicle in 2019 as part of its lineup expansion in the region. &&&&& &&&&& ===Oceania=== &&&&& GM is looking at expanding the Blazer to Australia and New Zealand as a Holden, but would retain the Blazer name and slotted as a mid size entry between the Acadia and Equinox as part of its expansion of its North American vehicles into this region. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& The use of the Blazer nameplate on a midsize CUV has sparked mixed reviews, mostly from fans of the K5 Blazer and S-10 Blazer SUVs, as well as the TrailBlazer faithful, who were disappointed in Chevrolet applying it to a CUV instead of importing the international TrailBlazer to North America, building it as an SUV on the same platform as the Suburban/Tahoe, or putting it on an SUV platform based on the Colorado, hopefully as an answer to Ford’s planned revival of the Bronco, citing the Blazer’s history as an adventurous off-road vehicle. &&&&& &&&&& In a side-by-side comparison with the Ford Edge, ''Car and Driver'' declared the Blazer the best, for its "responsive and stable handling, aggressive styling, and stout V-6 engine." &&&&& &&&&& The decision to build the Blazer in Mexico was criticized by the United Auto Workers, who wanted the vehicle built in the United States and is disappointed by GM’s reason behind the announcement to begin production outside the country, citing GM’s decision to cut back on its second shift workforce (and announced shutdown) at the Lordstown Assembly and moving production to Mexico. On January 10, 2019, The UAW announced that it has ordered its members to boycott the Blazer. Terry Dittes, director of the UAW’s GM Department, said the automaker has doubled down on cheaper labor in Mexico and continues to use temporary workers at U.S. plants, which robs laid-off UAW members of jobs. &&&&&  &&&&& While GM had already decided on Ramos Arizpe prior to the development of the Blazer, the union, as well as the automotive industry in general, is concerned that the possibility of President Donald Trump’s statement about raising tariffs on vehicles built outside the United States and threats to force automakers to bring jobs back to the country (based on his Twitter message made on June 22, 2018) could make things complicated, but GM has dismissed those theories and is confident about the Blazer’s prospects. &&&&& &&&&& The move also gave concerns for lawmakers from both political parties. U.S. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan), herself a former executive at GM, said her former employer's decision to idle U.S. plants in 2019, on top of the decision to produce the Blazer in Mexico, reinforces a belief that the just-agreed USMCA deal made by President Trump doesn't correct the soon-to-be-replaced NAFTA's problems: "Before I approve any trade agreement I am going to make sure we're writing trade agreements that level the playing field for the working men and women of this country, and that we're keeping jobs here, not making it easier to keep shipping jobs overseas... This GM announcement gives me greater concern, not less." &&&&& &&&&& On March 26, 2019, a Blazer and a Chevrolet Silverado were placed atop the Chevrolet Fountain at Detroit's Comerica Park, as the official vehicles for the Detroit Tigers' 2019 MLB baseball season. The Blazer was replaced a few days later by a Traverse, after complaints from automotive workers and enthusiasts in the local media, pointing out that it was made in Mexico, and the park's proximity to GM's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly, which is scheduled to go idle in 2020. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

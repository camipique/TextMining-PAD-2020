Charles Beavan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Charles Beavan''' (1805-1884) was a British barrister and law reporter. &&&&& &&&&& He was born in March 1805, the son of Hugh Beavan of Llowes, Radnorshire and educated at Aldenham and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating 22nd wrangler in 1829, B.A. in 1829, and M.A. in 1832. He became a barrister of the Middle Temple on 25 June 1830, and a bencher on 6 May 1873. He practised in Chancery courts and was an official examiner of Court of Chancery from June 1866 to January 1884 when that office was abolished. He was author of ''Reports of cases in Chancery argued and determined in the Rolls Court'' (1840-69), published in 36 volumes, the longest series of authorized reports ever published. &&&&& &&&&& He died at 91 St. George's Road, Pimlico, London on 18 June 1884. On 21 June 1884, the Solicitors Journal said that Beavan 'might probably claim the distinction of being in legal circles and publications the "most mentioned" man of his day'. &&&&& &&&&& Beavan's Reports are reprinted in volumes 48 to 55 of the English Reports. They have also been reproduced in microform. The Law Times published a digest of these reports. &&&&& &&&&& The National Portrait Gallery has a photograph of Beavan taken in the 1860s by Leonida Caldesi. Beavan had one son, Charles Albert Beavan. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *Charles Shaw. "Beavan, Charles" The Inns of Court Calendar: A Record of the Members of the English Bar. Butterworths.

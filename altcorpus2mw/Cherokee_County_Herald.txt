Cherokee County Herald &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''''Cherokee County Herald''''' is a weekly newspaper in Centre, AL. It has been under the ownership of ''Cherokee County Post'' since 2017 and the two Centre weeklies have a combined circulation of 17,000. &&&&& &&&&& Ownership &&&&& The ''Herald'' was founded by Joseph M. Shaw Sr. in 1938. He was a veteran and an active member in his community, participating in the Lion's Club, Centre Chamber of Commerce, and First Baptist Church. Joseph "Joe" Shaw Jr., who was 17 when the paper first started, became assistant publisher of the ''Herald''. He left his position at the paper for four years while he was in the Army and returned in 1946 as associate editor and publisher, and eventually took on ownership of the paper after his father's death in 1965. &&&&& &&&&& It was the only weekly newspaper in Cherokee County until 1984, when Consolidated Publishing Co. started the ''Cherokee Sun'' as a weekly shopper. The ''Sun'' was later sold to the Cherokee Publishing Co., publishers of the ''Cherokee County Herald''. The shopper merged with the ''Cherokee County Herald'' and was provided to every household in the county not subscribed to the ''Herald''. &&&&& &&&&& Melrose Shaw briefly became publisher after her husband's death, then retired from the newspaper business and sold the ''Herald'' to News Publishing Co. David Crawford Jr., owner of the ''Cherokee County Post'', bought the ''Herald'' from the News Publishing Company in 2017, restoring local ownership to the paper. &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +APA Better Newspaper Contest &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Place &&&&& &&&&& Recipient &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Best Editorial Page or Section &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& staff &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Best Sports Single Event Story &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Best Sports News In-Depth Coverage &&&&& &&&&& 3rd &&&&& &&&&& staff &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +Alabama Sports Writers Association &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Place &&&&& &&&&& Recipient &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Best Game Story &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Best Column or Feature &&&&& &&&&& 2nd &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Best Story or Series Writing, Column &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Best Story or Series Writing, Column &&&&& &&&&& 2nd &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Best Story or Series Writing, Game Story &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Best Story or Series Writing, Game Story &&&&& &&&&& 2nd &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Herby Kirby Memorial Award &&&&& &&&&& 1st &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +Cherokee County Museum and Historical Society &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Recipient &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& &&&&& Baker-Dean Media Award &&&&& &&&&& Shannon Fagan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External Links &&&&& e-Edition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

174	Brownout_(band)
Brownout (band) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Brownout''' is an American latin-funk band from Austin, Texas. The band is a side project of the members of the Grammy-award winning band Grupo Fantasma. &&&&& &&&&& Though the band was formed in 2003, as Grupo Fantasma took off in the early 2000s, Brownout was left "on the backburner", and the band's first album, "Homenaje", wasn't released until 2008. Since then, the band has toured regularly across the United States, at events including Bonnaroo, High Sierra Music Festival, and Utopia Festival. Brownout has also served as a backing band for artists including Prince, Daniel Johnston, GZA and Bernie Worrell. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014, the group released a series of covers of the British band Black Sabbath under the moniker "Brown Sabbath", which received praise from Black Sabbath lead-vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, as well as critical acclaim from NPR, AllMusic and ''Rolling Stone''. &&&&& &&&&& Brownout has released five albums: "Homenaje" (2008), "Aguilas & Cobras" (2009), "Oozy" (2012) and "Brownout presents Brown Sabbath" (2015), and most recently, "Fear of a Brown Planet" (2018). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ali Wazir &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Muhammad Ali Wazir''' (Pashto/Urdu: ) is a Pakistani politician who has been a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan since August 2018. He is a leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life and family &&&&& Ali Wazir belongs to the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe of the Pashtuns. His father, Malik Mirzalam Wazir, was the chief of the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe. Ali Wazir received his early education in Wanna, South Waziristan. While studying law at Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, he was influenced by the International Marxist Tendency group and became a political activist. In 2003, Ali Wazir's elder brother Farooq Wazir, who was a tribal leader and activist critical of the Taliban's presence in Waziristan, was assassinated by the Taliban militants. It marked the start of a long campaign during which the Taliban killed thousands of local activists, politicians, and clerics in the Pashtun tribal areas who had opposed the Taliban. In July 2005, while Ali Wazir was in prison under the Frontier Crimes Regulations, the Taliban assassinated his father, brother, two uncles, and two cousins in a single ambush near their home. From 2003 to 2018, sixteen family members of Ali Wazir were killed by the militants. &&&&& &&&&& The militants also ruined the businesses owned by his family. His family's gas stations were demolished, their tube wells were filled with dirt, and their apple and peach orchards were sprayed with poisonous chemicals. In 2016, their market in Wanna was blown up with dynamite. After the blowing up of the market, the locals of Wanna were prevented from collecting donations to help Ali Wazir's family. “They were told it would set an unacceptable precedent because the government cannot let anyone help those it punishes,” Ali Wazir wrote in his article. &&&&& &&&&& 2018 attack on Ali Wazir &&&&& On June 3, 2018, pro-government gunmen affiliated with the Taliban attacked Ali Wazir and other supporters of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) in Wanna, South Waziristan. Ali Wazir survived but at least four supporters of PTM were killed in the attack while dozens others, including Ali Wazir's cousin Arif Wazir and a local journalist Noor Ali Wazir, were injured. Many of the injured were taken to hospitals in Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. &&&&& &&&&& The dispute between the two parties in Wanna had started on June 2 when a pro-government militant leader Ainullah Wazir took away Pashteen hats from PTM activists by force and set the hats on fire. To condemn the act of the militant leader, Ali Wazir announced that a protest sit-in was to be held by PTM in Wanna from June 4. In response, the militants with guns went to Ali Wazir's home and asked him to either leave the area or leave PTM. When Ali Wazir refused to comply with their demand, they attacked Wanna's Mirzalam Market and a nearby petrol pump owned by Ali Wazir. However, a large number of unarmed PTM supporters gathered at the market to support Ali Wazir and resisted the militants, after which the militants indiscriminately opened fire on the PTM supporters. The PTM leader Mohsin Dawar alleged that when the militants fled after the attack was repulsed, security forces reached the area who also opened fire on the unarmed PTM supporters, injuring many of them. Mohsin Dawar added: “Even though the military imposed a curfew in the area, but it has not discouraged the people from coming out and expressing their support for the PTM.” The PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen also claimed that the attackers were backed by the Pakistan Army and intelligence agencies. Following a protest call by Pashteen, PTM held protest rallies in several cities including Peshawar, Quetta, and Islamabad to condemn the attack on Ali Wazir. &&&&& &&&&& On June 4, the Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor confirmed at a press conference that the attack on the PTM activists in Wanna was carried out by a government-sponsored "peace committee". &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& &&&&& Ali Wazir ran for the seat of the National Assembly of Pakistan as an independent candidate from Constituency NA-41 (Tribal Area-VI) in Pakistani general election, 2008 but was unsuccessful.

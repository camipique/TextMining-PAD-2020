He served in this position until his election to parliament in June 2016. &&&&& &&&&& He attracted some media attention in 2015 for stating that Croatia's Operation Storm (1995) was "an illegitimate action taken by the Croatian Army, police, and paramilitary units in the area under United Nations (UN) protection," the principle objective of which was "not to ensure the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, but exclusively to banish citizens of Serbian nationality from their homes." He added that Croatia had failed to adequately combat anti-Serb sentiments among its population and called on the country's leadership to establish better neighbourly relations. &&&&& &&&&& The Movement of Socialists has been aligned with the Serbian Progressive Party since 2010, and the party contested the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the Progressive Party's ''Aleksandar Vučić – Serbia Is Winning'' electoral list. Torbica received the forty-seventh position on the list and was elected when it won a landslide victory with 131 out of 250 mandates. Along with other Movement of Socialists parliamentarians, he serves in a parliamentary group with the People's Peasant Party and the United Peasant Party. He is currently a member of the assembly committee on constitutional and legislative issues and the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; a deputy member of the culture and information committee and the European integration committee; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Brazil, China, Cuba, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Russia, Spain, the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Venezuela. &&&&& &&&&& Torbica was physically attacked by unknown assailants in Kosovska Mitrovica in January 2017.

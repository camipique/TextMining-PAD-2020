The Casona de San Marcos is the main reference of the cultural and artistic activity of the university, and one of the best preserved constructions of the colonial era in Lima. &&&&& Panoramic view of the Cultural Center of the University of San Marcos.

At this time, the dimensions of the novitiate that was called that of San Antonio Abad, was five or even six times larger than the current size of La Casona. After being partially destructed by the earthquake of 1746 the Jesuits rebuilt it again, with a new design, completing the current building. In 1767 three years after the expulsion of the Jesuit order, Viceroy of Peru Manuel d'Amat i de Junyent founded the Real Convictorio de San Carlos, a type of university, in the former ecclesiastical building, in honor to the Bourbon King Charles III of Spain. This college reached great apogee from the end-18th century until 19th century. &&&&& &&&&& After the proclamation of the independence, in 1821, the college continues its work with an almost complete autonomy with respect to the University of San Marcos, until in 1867 it decrees the inclusion of the college of San Carlos and of the Independencia (San Fernando) into it. &&&&& &&&&& Since the transfer of the university, La Casona remained a place of great historical value and importance not only for the university but for the city of Lima. Since the Casona suffered a damage caused by the earthquake of 1966, the university was transferred to the new University City, its current main headquarters. So the set of La Casona were enabled to lodge the institutions of cultural extension of the university. &&&&& &&&&& In 1989, the National University of San Marcos, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and the National Institute of Culture signed a cooperation agreement Peru-Spain to restore the architectural set and to be dedicated to culture, research and artistic creations. The works were carried out with the economic and technical support of the Spanish Cooperation. &&&&& &&&&& At present, the Casona huouses the San Marcos Cultural Center, which offers cultural extension courses, exhibitions and is home to several university museums and research centers.

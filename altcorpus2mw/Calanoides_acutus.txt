Stage I through III copepodites are generally found from sea level to of depth. Older stages, on the other hand, are found in the top during the summer, except during December, when they are found in the top . ''C. acutus'' starts to descend in February, although this is affected by the food supply, with individuals in the northern portion of the range, like in Drake Passage, only starting to winter during mid-March. Individuals, mainly stage IV and V copepodites, winter to between about . There is no evidence of diel vertical migration in this species. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

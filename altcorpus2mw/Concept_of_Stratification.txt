207	Concept_of_Stratification
Concept of Stratification &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Target set, states and strata in CST &&&&& '''Concept of Stratification''', labelled CST by Prof Lotfi A. Zadeh, was proposed in 2016. Zadeh states that it is a reform in conventional problem solving methods by the consideration of a recursive problem solving approach. Note that this concept should not be mistaken with other similar concepts such as social stratification. CST is not based on social stratification nor related to it. More particularly it is quite different from the previous versions and applications of stratiﬁcation, such as stratiﬁed logic, stratified approach, stratified programming, stratified analysis, among other versions of stratification prior to 2016. This version of stratiﬁcation can handle a range of problems as explained a year after the original proposal by Asadabadi and his colleagues. &&&&& &&&&& The key innovation in CST is that it considers the target first, and then the target is gradually enlarged to include the system which is aimed to receive the target. After the system is contained in the enlarged target, the target gradually shrinks to let the system find the target. This method has similarities to the human mind problem solving and is expected to be employed widely in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in near future. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Charlotte Desmares &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Lépicié after a painting by Charles Antoine Coypel. &&&&& '''Christine Antoinette Charlotte Desmares''' (1682 – 12 September 1753) was a French female actor. She was known as '''la Desmares''' and also nicknamed '''Lolotte'''. She was the elder sister of the actor la Dangeville. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& She was born in Copenhagen to the comic actors Nicolas Desmares and Anne d'Ennebault and trained under her aunt la Champmeslé. She made her stage début aged sixteen with the Comédie-Française company on 30 January 1699 in ''Oreste et Pylade'' by Lagrange-Chancel. In only three months she became so successful that she was accepted as a full member of the company to replace her aunt, who had left it in 1698. Like her aunt she played tragic roles (such as Hermione in ''Andromaque'' and Émilie in ''Cinna'') as well as comedy ones (such as 'The Reader' in ''Le Légataire universel'' by Regnard and 'la Néréine' in ''Le Curieux impertinent'' by Destouches). She retired in 1721. &&&&& &&&&& Antoine Watteau, ''Actors of the Comédie-Française'' (1710-1712), Hermitage Museum - Desmares is the figure to the far left. &&&&& She became mistress to Louis, Grand Dauphin then to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, with whom she had a daughter in 1702, named Angélique de Froissy by her father and married off to count Henri François de Ségur.

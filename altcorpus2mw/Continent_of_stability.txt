120	Continent_of_stability
Continent of stability &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''continent of stability''' is a hypothesised large group of nuclides with atomic weights greater than 300 that is stable against decay, and consisting of up down quark matter rather than protons and neutrons. The continent of stability is named in analogy with the island of stability, however if it exists the range of charge and mass will be much greater than in the island. Quark matter composed of up quarks and down quarks is predicted to be a lower energy state than that which contains strange quarks, and also lower than the combination of quarks in the form of hadrons found in normal atomic nuclei if there are over 300 protons and neutrons. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

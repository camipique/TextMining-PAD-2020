Alexander Macansh &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Alexander Macansh''' (1803-1866), worked for 38 years as a flax heckler in the Scottish burgh of Dunfermline. In spite of being partially crippled, in very poor health and suffering episodes of deep depression, after a 14-hour working day he read and studied at home, producing poetry, journalistic articles and scientific lectures. He published an anthology of his poetry and a collection of autobiographical works and the texts of his lectures. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& Alexander was born in 1803 in the small town of Doune, near Stirling, the illegitimate son of a young flax heckler, Alexander Macansh snr. Nothing is known about his mother and he was brought up by his grandparents, James Macansh (also a flax heckler) and Mary Spittal Macansh. His grandfather died in 1805 and Alexander's memories of his early life are all of his grandmother, who he celebrated in a poem written 50 years later. &&&&& &&&&& Well I remember all her homely ways &&&&& Her cup of tea at early morning tide. &&&&& When, creeping from our curtained sleeping place &&&&& I nestled down, half naked, at her side. &&&&& Receiving from her kind, ungrudging hand &&&&& The other crust and, with the other crust, &&&&& Some fondling token of maternal trust. &&&&& Well I remember how each Sabbath morn &&&&& She dressed and trimmed me out, and led me down &&&&& To the small village kirk, so old and worn &&&&& I firmly holding by her mourning gown &&&&& Dressed in my Highland kilt and milk-white hose &&&&& She in her widow weeds and high-heeled shoon, &&&&& Above her tremulous head and shoulders rose. &&&&& &&&&& Alexander would have started his education at the village school at the age of five or six and one of the things that struck him was the habit of Mr Young, the domini, of dismissing his pupils at the end of each day with a Latin quotation. If he had continued at the school into his teenage years he might have learned Latin, but at the age of eleven he was taken to Dunfermline and apprenticed to a flax dresser. In his poem he remembered &&&&& &&&&& ....that dark winter morn when Mary stood - &&&&& stood with me in the lamp-light at her door. &&&&& Her withered cheek o'er glistening with the dew &&&&& Of farewell sorrow; for she inly knew &&&&& We were about to part for evermore - &&&&& She to the skies, and I to wander forth, &&&&& Our ways divided wide as heaven and earth. &&&&& &&&&& The apprenticeship was served in what Alexander referred to in his autobiographical work as a 'sale shop', where a few men manually prepared flax to be given out to an army of women working at their spinning wheels in their own homes. The final process in the preparation of flax for spinning was the combing out of the fibres with an implement called a heckle and the men who did the work were called either 'hecklers' or, more often, flax dressers. However, the days of the sale-shop were already numbered. The first steam-powered spinning mill in Dunfermline opened in 1792 and by 1814, when Alexander began his apprenticeship, there were a couple more, producing yarn for weaving and thread for sewing anything from a handkerchief to boots and shoes. In 1816 Andrew Rutherford opened a further mill at Harribrae, Dunfermline, manufacturing white and coloured yarns for table linen, ticking, sheetings, towelllngs and shirtiing, Alexander's father was an overseer at Rutherford's mill and it was no doubt he who found his son a job in one of the heckling shops, where the flax was prepared for the spinning machines. Alexander jnr worked in this trade until the mill closed in 1852. He later wrote that he worked at Rutherford's for thirty three years, so he would have started there in 1819, probably once he had completed his apprenticeship in the 'sale shop'.. &&&&& &&&&& The Heckling Shop &&&&& Alexander described his time in Rutherford's heckling shop in a long article called 'The Politics of the Workshop' which was published in instalments in 1854 in ''The Northern Warder and General Advertiser for the Counties of Fife, Perth, and Forfar'' and which he updated and included in his anthology ''Working Man's Bye Hours,'' published in 1866. The article, in accordance with its title, described in great detail the politics of some of his fellow workers and their discussions and arguments on the subject, but it also included information about their working conditions. The shop in which I wrought thirty years ago….held a dozen of us, six on each side with a window between every two. The centre of this window was a glazed fixture, the upper and under parts of this were hinged wooden blinds that could be lifted up or lowered down for the admission of fresh air or the emission of dust. In the winter months, November and December especially, this dust, the exhalation of a decayed vegetation, hung over our heads in a cloud so dense that one of my shopmates used to say, playfully, that he could write his name on it This was not the most Arcadian atmosphere for men to labour in from six in the morning till eight at night and not alone for days but for months and years. Many of the men were asthmatic and all were affected more or less with shortness of breath. Out of the dozen in our shop and six in another close by belonging to the same employers, are all dead with the exception of myself and another man.Not only did Alexander spend his working life in this thoroughly unhealthy environment, at the age of sixteen he had been 'attacked with severe pains in his limbs, which, accompanied with a series of cruel accidents reduced him ere he attained his twenty-first year "to a state of dwarfish deformity" which exposed him to 'the constant taunts and jeers of his rougher fellow-workmen and the still more torturing expressions of pity from the more kindly-hearted'.. ‘The trade at which the writer was employed for thirty-eight years – that of a flax dresser – was of that kind with permits conversation during working hours. The noise is not such as to drown the sound of the voice, but in a large shop, in which a dozen, or perhaps a score of heckles, are ringing, it is so great as to require the voice to be pitched on a rather high key, that the words may be heard and understood. Hecklers, for this reason, have a rather disagreeable habit of talking and reading in the octave key, even in a private room where there is not necessity for any particular elevation of voice.'Alexander also chronicled some lighter moments in the life of the heckling shop, such as the antics of a pet bird and the hecklers' excursions into the countryside with a donkey they had adopted.....we had a shop bird – indeed we almost always had a bird of some sort – a blackbird, a mavis (song thrush) or a linnet….The bird in question was a green linnet, a fine, strong chap with the closest and glossiest plumage. Dick would feed from the hand, perch upon a shoulder and, above everything in the world, delight in a fight. He would stand in the door of his cage and bending cock-fashion, unshuffled his tippet and attack the finger….We always left his cage door open and gave him full liberty of wing and Dick would suddenly bolt out of his wired domicile and disappearing in the wood behind the shop or west in the fields, be absent for hours amusing himself, how or where no-one could say. Then, all at once, he would dive in through one of the windows and, after taking a sweep two or three times round, would again enter his cage and be tail-up in his seed box ere one could count two. One day when the shopmates were in a very disagreeable mood, launching uncourteous epithets at each other, Dick suddenly swooped in through an open window from one of his excursions and circling round overhead, made a salute at every paper cap as he passed. The effect was electric. A good-humoured laugh took the place of angry invectives and a harmonious conversation followed.In Alexander's newspaper article he gave vivid descriptions of the lifestyles that produced produced differing political opinions, beginning with the aristocrat, followed by the middle class merchant and ending with the workman.The poor workman, again, standing at the foot of the social ladder is by position a Radical - a Chartist. He says, "It is no fault of mine that I am poor, but because I am poor I am disenfranchised, am I? My father, like myself, was a hard working man, with a numerous family and he might have been, in the opinion of these two gentlemen up the trap, not very intelligent. I got little or no schooling. How could I? My mother set me down at the pirn wheel when I was nine years of age. Thence I was sent to the loom when I was eleven. Unfit to pace the treadles from the brevity of my yet ungrown limbs, they had at first to nail bars to enable me to work them with success. I wrought at the trade of making table covers for the more fortunate portions of society for many years, giving my earnings to my parents to enable them to live and bring up the rest and I arrived at manhood with one suit of clothes and my brain as unfurnished as my back with anything more substantial than politics.It was the custom of the men in the heckling shop to buy various newspapers and they took turns at reading them out loud while the work went on. We had two newspapers and a weekly political pamphlet. One of them was the ''Scotsman'', not generally liked by our Radical shopmates, for it was then, thirty-five years ago, now forty-seven, wholly literary and political and the tone of its articles, though the most liberal in Scotland at that period, did not come up to our men's ideas of the true Radical standard. The favourites were ''Wooler's Gazette'' and his ''Black Dwarf'', the former long since defunct - a firebrand and, like all its class, as stupid as it was violent. The latter a firebrand also....We read by turns, column about, commencing with the editor's commentary, then the Parliamentary debates, then the miscellaneous matter - a murder or a horrible accident always having the preference.The 'Wooler' of the Gazette was Thomas Jonathon Wooler, a radical political journalist whose ''Black Dwarf'' was published on Sundays from 1817 to 1824. A more long-lived Wooler publication was ''The British Gazette'' which also came out on a Sunday (not to be confused with ''The British Gazette'' produced by the Government during the General Strike of 1926.) &&&&& &&&&& Scholar, Poet, Journalist and Lecturer &&&&& Alexander Macansh was keenly aware of his lack of formal education and as soon as he was able he set out to remedy this situation. After working a fourteen-hour day from 6.00 am to 8.00 pm, having eaten his supper he settled down to his studies.In his humble abode in one of the closes off the High Street of Dunfermline, he held championship with the greatest and brightest of intellects. He resumed the Latin studies which fascinated him in his early boyhood at Doune, when old Mr Young, the village schoolmaster, was wont to dismiss his scholars with a classical phrase and caused a far-sounding shout of Ad scholam to be piped when the hour for opening the school approached. He also taught himself French and two or three other Continental languages, without, of course, becoming scholastically proficient; and I think he also knew a little Greek and Hebrew, on which he occasionally held consultations with his friend the Rev. James Mackenzie of the Free Abbey Church. He kept well abreast, too, with modern science and literature, as his published essays and lectures show. He was held in respect by the most cultured men in the town.As Alexander became better-known to the 'cultured men' he probably borrowed the necessary books from them, but he could also have made use of the library of the Dunfermline Mechanics' Institution which was founded in 1825. &&&&& &&&&& His output of poetry was prodigious. In 1850 his anthology ''The Social Curse (or Intemperance): A Rhyme and Other Pieces'' was published in Edinburgh. The 'Rhyme' of the title extended to fifty-three pages and was accompanied by fifty-three 'Other Pieces'. Several of his poems had already been published in various periodicals - the ''Scotsman'' in 1828 and 1830 and also in ''Tait's Magazine'' and ''The Edinburgh Literary Journal''. &&&&& &&&&& Published works &&&&& &&&&& * ''The Social Curse (or Intemperance): A Rhyme and Other Pieces'' published Edinburgh 1850 &&&&& *''Two Essays on the Benefits of Savings Banks to the Working Classes'' by Alexander Macansh and James Cousin.

Blue Hole (Rawley Springs) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Blue hole''' refers to a frequented swimming hole just past Rawley Springs, Virginia situated in the Dry River. The boundaries of the George Washington National Forest surround the swimming hole. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& The Rawley Springs area has a history of European settlers and their descendants, mostly men, purchasing and building vacation stays and fine boarding houses in the area. A series of fires in the 1800s brought these buildings down. Today there is a cluster of homes making up the Rawley Springs area. Commercialization of the area, like building hotels and resorts, is no longer allowed. &&&&& &&&&& The springs, which feed into the Dry River are said to be a place of healing. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Use &&&&& &&&&& The swimming hole has not been developed with a parking area and easy access, although for some this is also the allure. Most people park on the shoulder of Route 33 just past Rawley Springs heading west. A short but steep climb down to the river follows. The path's location is unmarked but worn enough to be noticeable. &&&&& &&&&& Note: This article refers to Blue Hole adjacent to US Route 33. There is a second Blue Hole swimming area near Bergton, VA. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

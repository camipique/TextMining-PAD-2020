Charles W. Stage &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Charles Willard Stage''' (1868–1946) was an American attorney, politician, professional baseball umpire and amateur track athlete. While attending Western Reserve University, Stage tied an amateur world record in the 100-yard dash and briefly became a National League baseball umpire in 1894. After finishing law school, he was a private practice attorney and served in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1902–03 before returning to law practice. &&&&& &&&&& Stage was married to Miriam Kerruish, one of the first women to practice medicine in Cleveland. She died in 1929, and he retired after his most notable law clients (the Van Sweringen brothers) lost their fortune in the Great Depression. He was sometimes known as '''Billy Stage''', particularly in baseball circles. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Stage was born in Painesville, Ohio, and he lived there through his high school graduation. He then attended Adelbert College of Western Reserve, where he ran track, played baseball and captained the first varsity football team that the college ever fielded. At a track meet in 1890, Stage won seven events, and in six of those events he posted the best time of any college student in Ohio that year. The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) did not recognize athletic events at Western Reserve at first; he was first allowed to compete in AAU events in 1892, the year he finished an undergraduate degree. In 1893, Stage, now a Western Reserve law student, tied a world record by running the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds at an AAU event. &&&&& &&&&& Umpiring career &&&&& In April 1894, Stage was still studying law when he was hired by the National League to serve as an umpire. During a time when umpires worked by themselves, Stage's speed allowed him to get good views of the plays anywhere on the field. Infielder Hughie Jennings recalled that Stage might even slide next to a runner if he thought it would give him a better angle to make a close call. After his umpiring debut, the ''Pittsburgh Press'' noted that he offered "a relief from the usual lazy style of umpiring." &&&&& &&&&& Umpires in that era, however, were often not appreciated; they sometimes faced threats of physical violence and turnover was high. Cleveland Spiders manager Patsy Tebeau later described how players often ran after the umpire to attack him at the end of a game. He recalled that Stage was the most frustrating umpire to chase. "The whole team took after him time and again, but never once did he fail to get over the back fence ahead of us. We could never catch him. Finally I protested to President Young and Stage resigned," Tebeau said. &&&&& &&&&& Stage dealt with unspecified illnesses several times that year, and whether or not Tebeau had a role in it, Stage cited poor health when he resigned that July after working 45 games. Over the next year he did return to the field five times, all for games that were being held in Cleveland, but he did not umpire at all after 1895. There were rumors that he might return to track and field, raising questions about his amateur athletic status after working as a major league umpire, but Stage gave his full attention to his law studies at that point. &&&&& &&&&& Law and public service &&&&& Stage was in the first graduating class at Western Reserve's law school, and then he opened a private law practice. He served as Cleveland's first utilities director after home rule was established. Stage came to know Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson and began to take an increased interest in politics. He served as a Democratic member of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1902 and 1903. In April 1902, Stage argued for the passage of a resolution that allowed Ohioans to vote on whether the governor should have veto power. The measure passed the House; it was approved by voters the following year, giving the Governor of Ohio the most extreme veto power in the United States. &&&&& &&&&& After Stage returned to the practice of law, he was counsel for the Van Sweringen railroad barons for several years. Stage served on the boards of directors for several entities, including the Cleveland Union Terminal, later known as Tower City Center. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In 1903, Stage married a physician, Miriam Gertrude Kerruish, and they had four children. He had married into a successful family. Kerruish cared for women and children, many of them indigent. She was one of the first women to practice medicine in Cleveland and was the first woman credentialed to practice at Cleveland City Hospital. Kerruish's father William was an immigrant from the Isle of Man and, like Stage, had worked his way through Western Reserve to become a lawyer. Miriam Kerruish's brother, Sheldon Quayle Kerruish, was also an attorney. &&&&& &&&&& Miriam Kerruish died in the Cleveland Clinic fire of 1929. A few years after his wife's death, Stage inherited a large tract of land from the Kerruish family located in what is now known as Cleveland's Lee–Miles neighborhood. Stage donated the land to the city and Kerruish Park was established. He retired when the Great Depression destroyed the Von Sweringens' holdings and he died in 1946, never having remarried. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

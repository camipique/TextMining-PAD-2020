Christopher J. Bishop &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Christopher Bishop''' is an American mathematician at Stony Brook University. He is known for his contributions to geometric function theory, Kleinian groups, complex dynamics, and computational geometry; and in particular for topics such as fractals, harmonic measure, conformal and quasiconformal mappings and Julia sets. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1987, under the supervision of Peter Jones. &&&&& &&&&& Bishop was awarded the 1992 A. P. Sloan Foundation fellowship, was an invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians. He was included in the 2019 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society "for contributions to the theory of harmonic measures, quasiconformal maps and transcendental dynamics". &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& With Yuval Peres, Bishop is the author of the book ''Fractals in Probability and Analysis'' (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics 162, 2009). &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Home page &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

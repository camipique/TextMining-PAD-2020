Angelika Unterlauf &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Angelika Unterlauf''' (born 1946 in Gröningen) is a German television journalist. As the spokeswoman of the main GDR television news programme, the Aktuelle Kamera, she was regarded as the "face of the GDR" until the German reunification. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& In 1977, Angelika Unterlauf, a trained architectural draftswoman, made her debut as a speaker in the studios of the Aktuelle Kamera. However, she had already gained experience as a spokeswoman for radio since 1969, for example at the ''Notenbude'', a rock music programme at the Stimme der DDR radio station. In 1985, she was voted "TV favourite of the year" by the readers of the GDR TV magazine ''FF dabei''. &&&&& &&&&& Unterlauf joined the SED in 1987, retired in 1989. &&&&& &&&&& On July 2, 1990, Angelika Unterlauf spoke the news in DFF's AK am Abend for the last time and was dismissed in 1991. Afterwards she worked as an off speaker for Spiegel TV. She has been a full-time editor at Sat.1 since 1993. &&&&& &&&&& Even before 1989 she became famous in the Federal Republic of Germany when singer ''Lonnie'' (aka: former RIAS employee Klaus Heilbronner) dedicated the song ''Angelika vom Fernsehen in der DDR'' to her. It took several months for Unterlauf to refute the Stasi's accusation of maintaining a relationship with Heilbronner. &&&&& &&&&& On 17 August 2004 she married the journalist and TV presenter Erich Böhme. The couple had been living in a former manor house on the lake in Worin since May 2006. Angelika Unterlauf has two daughters and has been a widow since 27 November 2009. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

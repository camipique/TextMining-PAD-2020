She was less able to give expression to strong passions then to mild, gracious characters", and it was said of her that she attracted attention with "her unusually fragile features, the thin, tall figure as well as an inborn or at least early on trained ability to act with dignity and easy grace on stage". &&&&& &&&&& She was given the Litteris et Artibus by King Oscar II. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& * Ingeborg Nordin Hennel: Mod och Försakelse.

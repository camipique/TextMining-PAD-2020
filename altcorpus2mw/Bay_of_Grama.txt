Bay of Grama &&&&& Introduction &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& The '''Bay of Grama''' ( â€” ) is a bay of the Ionian Sea situated along the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast on the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe. It is one of many bays of the western Ceraunian Mountains along the Albanian Riviera south of the Karaburun Peninsula. &&&&& &&&&& The bay is home to precious archaeological, historical and cultural values, as it served as an important harbour and shelter for the ones sailing along the coast during classical antiquity. On the vertical cliffs and rocks, there are numerous carved inscriptions in Ancient Greek, Latin and Medieval Greek; the name of the bay is closely associated with engraved inscriptions. During the Second World War it was used at a base for the Special Operations Executive. &&&&& &&&&& Representing a rocky bay, the shore is dominated by coastal cliffs, sloping vertically into the sea, and rocky, pebbled beaches. It stretches within the Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park and was designated as a natural monument because of its outstanding landscape dotted with solutional and sea caves. &&&&& &&&&& The precious landscapes of the bay are of global importance, because they contribute to the country's ecological balance and provide habitat for numerous globally threatened and endangered species. The sea caves are an exceptional ecosystem and give important refuge to the mediterranean monk seal, the rarest seal species in the world. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&&  &&&&& * Albanian Ionian Sea Coast &&&&& * List of bays of Albania &&&&& * Biodiversity of Albania &&&&& * Geography of Albania &&&&& * Protected areas of Albania &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

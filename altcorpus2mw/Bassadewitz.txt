Bassadewitz &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Bassadewitz''', also called '''Passadewitz''', '''Bassarowitz''' or '''Passarowitz''', is a card game for 4 players in the Hearts family. &&&&& &&&&& First recorded in the early nineteenth century and still played as a family game in parts of German-speaking Europe. It is a member of the trick avoidance group of playing cards. &&&&& &&&&& Playing &&&&& Dealer puts up a pool of twelve chips and deals eight cards each from a 32-card pack of French or German playing cards ranking and counting as follows: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ranks and card-point values of cards''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''German-suited cards''' &&&&& &&&&& A/D &&&&& &&&&& 10 &&&&& &&&&& K &&&&& &&&&& O &&&&& &&&&& U &&&&& &&&&& 9 &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& 7 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''French-suited cards''' &&&&& &&&&&    A &&&&& &&&&& 10 &&&&& &&&&& K &&&&& &&&&& Q &&&&& &&&&& J &&&&& &&&&& 9 &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& 7 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Value''' &&&&& &&&&& 11 &&&&& &&&&& 10 &&&&& &&&&& 4 &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& – &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Eldest leads to the first trick and the winner of each trick leads to the next. Suit must be followed if possible. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led. There are no trumps. &&&&& &&&&& Scoring &&&&& Whoever takes the fewest card-points wins 5 chips, second fewest 4, third fewest 3. Ties are settled in favour of the eldest player, but a player taking no trick beats one who merely takes no card-points. &&&&& &&&&& A player winning every trick is paid 4 each by the others and a player taking 100 or more in card-points, but failing to win every trick, pays 4 each to the other players. In these cases, the pool remains intact and the same dealer deals again, as also if all four take the same number of card-points. &&&&& &&&&& Variant &&&&& Ace may count 5 points instead of 11, and each player adds 1 point per trick to his total of card points, which may be classified as the easiest form to play the game &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Literature &&&&& * ''Bassadewitz''.

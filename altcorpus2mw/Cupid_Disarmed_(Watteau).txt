Cupid Disarmed (Watteau) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 300px &&&&& '''''Cupid Disarmed''''' (French - ''L'Amour désarmé'') is a c.1715 painting, usually but not definitively attributed to Antoine Watteau. It is one of eight paintings kept by Watteau's friend and protector Jean de Jullienne until the latter's death in 1766. Benoît Audran engraved it in 1727 and described and reproduced it in an inventory of the Jullienne collection in 1756. After Jullienne's death the art dealer Boileau bought it for Jean-Baptiste de Montullé, Jullienne's executor. &&&&& &&&&& It was sold again in 1783 and seems to have been sold from the hôtel Bullion to a British collector after the Reign of Terror, before returning to France just before 1848. It then entered the collection of the marquis de Maison, with which it was bought by Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale in 1868, who hung it in the salle de la Tribune in his château de Chantilly. It still forms part of the Musée Condé. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:Paintings of the Musée Condé &&&&& category:Paintings by Antoine Watteau &&&&& category:1710s paintings &&&&& category:Paintings of Venus &&&&& category:Paintings of Cupid &&&&& &&&&&

A Fool to Care &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''A Fool To Care''''' is the eighteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Boz Scaggs. It was released in the US on March 31, 2015, and in the UK on March 30, 2015, on 429 Records. The album was the second in a three-album series celebrating American roots music (''Memphis'' being released in 2013 and ''Out of the Blues'' in 2018). &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Rolling Stone writes, "These 12 songs map out a concise history of American soul, with a heavy dose of New Orleans strut... Backed throughout by a stellar group of studio aces — guitarist Ray Parker Jr., bassist Willie Weeks and drummer Steve Jordan, who also produced the album — Scaggs’ well-worn, textured voice deftly navigates this range of styles." &&&&& &&&&& Blues Rock Review writes, "On each song, Scaggs puts his decades of experience and emotional connections to American roots music to work, producing a collection that stands as one of this year’s best blues records to date." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& * Boz Scaggs – lead vocals, guitars, backing vocals &&&&& * Ray Parker Jr. – guitars &&&&& * Willie Weeks - bass &&&&& * Steve Jordan - drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

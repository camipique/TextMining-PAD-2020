Australasian Photo-Review &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& First page of the ''Australasian Photographic Review of Reviews'', later the ''Australasian Photographic Review'', later the ''Australasian Photo-Review''. &&&&& The '''''Australasian Photo-Review''''' was an English language magazine, published for photographers by Baker & Rouse and later Kodak (Australasia), and published in Sydney, Australia. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The magazine was first published in 1894 as the Australian edition of the ''British Photographic Review of Reviews'', after the photographic supply company Baker & Rouse purchased the Australasian publishing rights. At this early stage of its publication, the magazine was issued as a short ten to fifteen page supplement to the British edition. In 1895 the magazine's name was changed to ''Australalasian Photographic Review'', and in 1903, the title was shortened to ''Australalasian Photo-Review''. &&&&& &&&&& The first editor-in-chief of the magazine was Edwin J. Welch, who reported the declaration, within the first issue, that Australian photographic works would be reviewed with 'bluntness, perhaps, but no namby pamby'. In 1922 Eric Keast Burke became associate editor, and eventually editor, a position he held until the Review ceased publication in 1956. The Review is notable for promoting the work of Australian photographers or 'camerists', as they were referred to as in early editions, and for its inclusion of high-grade photographic prints. In 1952, Eric Keast Burke, while still acting as editor for the publication, rediscovered the wet plate negative collection of Bernhard Otto Holtermann, showing panoramas of Sydney, and the gold-fields of Hill End and Gulgong. &&&&& &&&&& Digitisation &&&&& The magazine has been digitised by the National Library of Australia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * ''Australasian Photo-Review'' at Trove &&&&& * ''Australasian Photographic Review of Reviews'' at Trove &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

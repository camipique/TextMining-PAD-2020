Chigi Altarpiece &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Chigi Altarpiece''' is an altarpiece by Perugino, dating to around 1506-1507. It is named after its commissioner Agostino Chigi, a Sienese banker, for the Chigi family chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in Siena, where it still hangs. &&&&& &&&&& Like most altarpieces by Perugino, it has two registers. The upper heavenly one shows Christ on the cross surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of angels and cherubim. The lower earthly register shows eight lamenting saints connected to the commissioner, the church and the chapel - on the right are John the Baptist and Jerome, for example. The deep landscape backgrounds shows hills and a clear sky. The work originally also had a predella, which is now divided between the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:Paintings depicting John the Baptist &&&&& category:Paintings of Saint Jerome &&&&& &&&&& category:Paintings by Pietro Perugino &&&&& category:1507 paintings &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

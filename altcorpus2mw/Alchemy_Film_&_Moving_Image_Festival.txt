Alchemy Film & Moving Image Festival &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Alchemy Film & Moving Image Festival''' is an annual film festival held in Scotland. It is considered a leading festival of experimental and artists' film within the UK and Europe. The first edition was held in September 2010 and the festival shows around 130 films each year, with a mixed programme of short films, feature films, moving image installations, specialist curated programmes and live expanded cinema performances. &&&&& &&&&& Situated in the rural Scottish Borders town of Hawick the festival's Creative Director, Richard Ashrowan, described its foundation as "a provocation to the prevailing urban-centrism in terms of culture". The main cinema screenings are held in an award-winning converted spinning mill, Tower Mill, which is part of Heart of Hawick, a key partner organisation for the festival. The festival also utilises a variety of disused and ex-industrial spaces for moving image installations throughout the town. &&&&& &&&&& Alchemy has premiered screenings by such filmmakers as Jan Švankmajer, Sarah Pucill, Andrew Kötting, Rachel Maclean, The Quay Brothers, Semiconductor (artists), Mike Hoolboom, Nina Danino, Patrick Bokanowski, Jacques Perconte, Mark Leckey, and Ben Rivers. &&&&& &&&&& Alchemy Film & Moving Image Festival is run by Alchemy Film & Arts, which is registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator. It develops projects for experimental film and artists’ moving image production in Scotland. These include artists’ filmmaking residencies, exhibitions programmes, filmmaking symposia, touring programmes and community film projects. In 2017, Alchemy Film & Arts curated Scotland’s national exhibition at the Venice Biennale, presenting a film commission by the artist filmmaker Rachel Maclean. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Alchemy Film & Moving Image Festival website &&&&& * Tower Mill at Heart of Hawick website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

On July 20, 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Galician Republicans were under attack. Andrade wanted to help the resistance, and became part of a group that tried to reach A Coruña, but the city was already taken, so he returned to Curtis. He took part on the robbery of arms in Fisteus. He also stole dinamite from the Teixeiro train station.

In April 1947 he moves to Pontevedra, now as the "Quinta Agrupación" leader. In October 1949 he escapes again from a Guardia Civil ambush to Riqueche, chief of ''Cortizas'' detachment. &&&&& &&&&& During the period between 1950 and 1951, with the maquis detachments very much weakened, Andrade moves to the area of Betanzos, with his loyal friend Manuel Villar, ''Manolito''.

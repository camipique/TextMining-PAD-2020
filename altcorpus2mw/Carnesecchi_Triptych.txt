144	Carnesecchi_Triptych
Carnesecchi Triptych &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The St Julian panel &&&&& The '''Carnesecchi Triptych''' was a c.1423-1425 altarpiece by Masolino, Masaccio and others, showing the Madonna and Child with Catherine of Alexandria and Julian the Hospitaller. It seems to mark the start of Masolino and Masaccio's collaboration. &&&&& &&&&& Dismembered in the 17th century, it is now totally lost except for panel showing Julian (Diocesan Museum of Santo Stefano al Ponte in Florence) and one of the three panels of the predella. That predella panel was long thought to be the painting by Masolino now in the Ingres Museum in Montauban, but recent expert studies by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure have instead identified it as a painting by Masaccio in the Museo Horne in Florence. &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& *http://www.carnesecchi.eu/Maggiore3.htm &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:1420s paintings &&&&& category:Paintings of the Museo Horne &&&&& category:Paintings by Masaccio &&&&& &&&&&

However, Mohor didn't return to him and chose to love Rohon and keep his memory in her mind, but remained separated from him for lifelong. The show also encompassed how Mohor fulfilled her aspirations by becoming a doctor, and served the diseased people with all her effort and dedication, in her humanitarian profession. Later, the series showed how Mohor reunited with her estranged (long-lost) daughter, Lin; completing the heartfelt story of her life-journey. &&&&& &&&&& Throughout its run, ''Binni Dhaner Khoi'' remained one of the leading daily soaps of that time on Bengali television, and had been received well widely by the masses. Its time slot has varied over the years, first airing at 8:30 PM, then at the 8:45 PM time slot and finally at 9:00 PM IST. The show went off air in mid-2012. &&&&& &&&&& Premise &&&&& This tale encompasses and reflects the images of laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, trials and tribulations that make up the lives of three generations. &&&&& 17-year old Mohor is a simple, bubbly and lively village girl. Her elder sister Gini's marriage is fixed with the modern-day, learned, charming city boy Rohon, but Gini loves someone else and elopes with her lover on the day of her marriage. So, Mohor has to take Gini's place as the bride and thus, gets married to Rohon at such an early age, without even having the knowledge of marriage. Over the course of their relationship, Mohor matures as a person, develops a loving relationship with Rohon's family members, especially with Rohon's mother and his paternal grandmother, Ana. Mohor later on falls in love with Rohon, who too develops a close bond with Mohor but loves Kurchi instead, his colleague at work. Kurchi gets Mohor and Rohon divorced after many plotting and scheming, and herself becomes Rohon's second wife. However, Rohon soon gets to see the true colours of Kurchi and gets irritated with her, and his love for Kurchi vanishes as well. Instead, Rohon seems to realize his feelings for Mohor to be true love, not mere affection. He tries to reunite with Mohor, but Mohor in a fit of rage refuses him, but also acknowledges her own emotional turmoil for Rohon, though she sticks to her decision. Mohor now totally focuses on her medical studies, after she is given the help and assistance by a genuine good-hearted person, whom later Kurchi falls in love with and subsequently marries, after willingly divorcing Rohon. Mohor passes her medical last year exams with flying colours, becoming an M.B.B.S. doctor. Meanwhile, a new man, Rishi enters Mohor's life and he develops an unrequited love for Mohor, much to Rohon's chagrin. However, Mohor decides to neither reconnect with Rohon nor to accept Rishi's proposal of marriage and build up her individual existence by serving people as a doctor instead. &&&&& &&&&& Rohon falls ill and seeks earnestly for Mohor, who now comes to his aid. One night, Rohon and Mohor get intimate, resulting in Mohor's pregnancy. However, Rohon soon dies from his vulnerable disease. Rishi stands by Mohor in this tough time and also requests Mohor to at least let him fulfill his duty as a friend by taking the responsibility of Mohor's baby. After an emotional confrontation, Ron confesses for the first time that she respects Rishi for what he is, how much important he is in her life and the fact that she loves Rishi, only next to Rohon. Rishi for one last time proposes Mohor to be his life partner, but Mohor, getting very emotional, refuses him once again; and they part ways. Few months later, Mohor gives birth to Rohon's daughter (Lin), but she is separated from Mohor at birth, adding more to her woes. &&&&& &&&&& ===Parallel tracks=== &&&&& Apart from showcasing Mohor's journey, the show also followed the story of some secondary characters, most notably Gini (Mohor's elder sister) and Ana (Rohon's grandmother). Like Mohor, Gini too didn't got true love in life and had to lead her life on her own as well, later on, becoming a primary school teacher. Ana's real name is Anwara Bibi and she was revealed to be a Muslim woman, a fact that was hard to accept for her own parents, in-las and family members. But, with Mohor's help, Ana finally obtained love and respect in her family, despite revealing her actual religion and heredity. &&&&& &&&&& ===21 years later=== &&&&& The story takes a "21 years leap", as it introduces some new characters, primarily Lin (Mohor and Rohon's grown-up daughter), who returns from US for conducting an assignment, but incidentally gets to know her roots and her true background. The sprightly Lin falls in love with Bubu (Kurchi's son) and the story deals with how Lin handles her marriage with Bubu amidst chaos and misunderstandings. The story arc also follows Mohor's remaining years of life as she finally reunites with her long-lost daughter, Lin, who also, upon clearing all misunderstandings, accepts Mohor as her mother and loves her form the deep core of heart as well. In the final episodes, it is shown how Mohor rejuvenates her initial days of life, all her quests to achieve stability and how she served the people generously, as she finally dies in peace at 46 years of age, putting an end to her lifelong struggle. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& === Main cast === &&&&& * Monami Ghosh as Mohor and Lin (Double Role) &&&&& :#Dr. Kojagori Mukherjee aka ''Mohor'' - Main Lead, Rohon's first wife, Rishi's love interest, Lin's mother. &&&&& :#Lin Banerjee - New/Second Main Lead, Mohor and Rohon's daughter, Bubu's wife, Chiru's love interest. &&&&& * Manoj Ojha as Rohon Banerjee - Main Lead, Mohor's husband, Kurchis' first husband, Lin's father.

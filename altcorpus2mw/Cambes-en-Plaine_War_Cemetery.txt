The cemetery contains 224 graves of which one is unidentified. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Following the Allied landings on D-Day, elements of the East Riding Yeomanry, supporting the British 3rd Infantry Division pushed through to the northern outskirts of Cambes-en-Plaine on 9 June 1944. A defensive German line here stopped the advance on Caen. A large number of burials date to between the 8 and 12 July 1944, during Operation Charnwood, the final attack on Caen. Over half of the burials in the graveyard are from soldiers in the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& The cemetery is located in the commune of Cambes-en-Plaine, in the Calvados department of Normandy, on the Rue du Mesnil Ricard (D.79B). &&&&& &&&&& Photographs &&&&& &&&&& File:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -1.JPG|Entrance to the war cemetery &&&&& File:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -3.JPG|Sacrificial cross in the cemetery &&&&& File:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -9.JPG|Brouay war cemetery &&&&& File:Cambes-En-Plaine_War_Cemetery_-8.JPG|Graves of 59th (Staffordshire) Division soldiers &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * American Battle Monuments Commission &&&&& * UK National Inventory of War Memorials &&&&& * German War Graves Commission &&&&& * List of military cemeteries in Normandy &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * Shilleto, Carl, and Tolhurst, Mike (2008).

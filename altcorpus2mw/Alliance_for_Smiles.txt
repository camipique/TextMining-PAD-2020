Alliance for Smiles &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Alliance for Smiles in Yangon, Myanmar in 2014 preparing for surgery. &&&&& '''Alliance for Smiles''' (AfS) is a nonproft organization founded in 2004 in San Francisco. They provide free surgical repairs for cleft lip and cleft palate anomalies in under-served areas of the world, with missions mostly in the continents of Asia and Africa. They also work to develop treatment centers where continuous follow-up care can be provided. &&&&& &&&&& Alliance for Smiles' founding members were Anita Stangl, Burt Berry, James Patrick, Jim Deitz, John Goings, and John Uth. Each of them had been involved with other cleft lip and palate organizations prior to Alliance for Smiles. Dr. Karin Vargervik, previous director of the Craniofacial Center at the University of California San Francisco, was chosen to lead the AfS treatment center program, which aims to create international treatment centers that replicate the U.S. protocol of cleft treatment. &&&&& &&&&& Surgical Missions &&&&& Alliance for Smiles organizes two-week surgical missions to provide free cleft lip and palate surgery in various under-served countries. The team consists of about 12 medical professionals and 4 non-medical volunteers. During a typical mission, 70 to 100 children receive surgical care. The AfS team collaborates with local medical practitioners to communicate on proper medical procedures and to give follow-up treatment. Follow-up care is often required because a patient may need follow-up surgeries, orthodontic treatment, speech therapy, and other medical care. &&&&& &&&&& Teaching Missions &&&&& During teaching missions Alliance for Smiles sends a small team of medical professionals to train local doctors and nurses on how to operate on very complex cleft cases. The AfS team works with local medical practitioners to exchange ideas on proper medical techniques and procedures, as well as to provide training and follow-up care. &&&&& &&&&& Treatment Centers &&&&& Treatment Centers are established where possible in countries to allow for long-term comprehensive care for patients with clefts, providing services such as speech therapy, orthodontia and social support. These centers are developed by Alliance for Smiles in partnership with local staff with the purpose of training the local staff to become self-sufficient eventually. &&&&& &&&&& Medical Internship Program &&&&& The International Medical Fellowship is a 14-day opportunity for students interested in the medical field to learn about cleft surgeries by supporting and observing doctors and nurses on an AfS mission. &&&&& &&&&& Partners &&&&& In order to continue its mission, AfS partners with Rotary International and Rotary Clubs around the world. To help facilitate their work in China, AfS works with a Chinese NGO called The China Population Welfare Foundation. Other partners include Stop Cleft-International Alliance, Globus Relief, Shanghai Ci Guang Skin Foundation, and Red Cross International. &&&&& &&&&& Leadership &&&&& &&&&& === Staff === &&&&& Alison Healy: CEO & Executive Director, Paul Vazquez: Director of Operations, Yulla-May Nicolas: Program Coordinator, Jeremy Rhodes: Finance Specialist, Fowler: Director of Photography, Wendy Schaefer: Art Director, Inga Lim: Photo Editor & Photographer, Anita Stangl: Special Consultant & Chair of China Transition Committee, Harry Wong: China Consultant, Helen Soo: Consultant. &&&&& &&&&& === Board Members === &&&&& Alison Healy, Anita Stangl, Benjamin Lam, Carl Vahl, Cecile Chiquette, Chih-Chen Fang, Jim Patrick, John Goings, John O'Connor, John Wong, Karin Vargevick, Karl Wustrack, Roderick Young, Rosemary Welde, and Tina Fischlin. &&&&& &&&&& === Honorary Board Members === &&&&& Dr. William Hoffman: Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at UCSF, Raphael Garcia III: Rotary International Director, Dr. Sally Peterson-Falzone: Speech Pathologist &&&&& &&&&& Recognition &&&&& *Alliance for Smiles was featured in the Consulate-General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco for being awarded a Certificate of Recognition for its contributions to providing free cleft lip and palate anomaly surgeries for families in China. &&&&& *Alliance for Smiles was featured in Wenzhou Government’s Official Web Portal for changing the lives of 54 cleft lip and palate anomaly patients in 10 days. &&&&& *Board member and founder Anita Stangl was featured in Arab America for her talk at the Commonwealth Club about Alliance for Smiles transforming the lives of children often left to die. &&&&& *Board member Dr. Karin Vargervik and Dr. William Y.

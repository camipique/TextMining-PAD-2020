Bombardier Ciudad Sahagun &&&&& Introduction &&&&& In 1992 Bombardier Transportation acquired its '''Bombardier Ciudad Sahagún''' plant from the Mexican government. The plant is in Ciudad Sahagún, Hidalgo. &&&&& &&&&& Since then the plant has been employed on a number of contracts.  &&&&& &&&&& The plant built a series of Electro-Motive Diesel locomotives. &&&&& &&&&& The plant has built over 100 light rail vehicles for rapid transit systems in Mexico's three largest cities, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City. The plant has built 70 percent of the rail vehicles in Mexico. &&&&& &&&&& Bombardier won contracts for two of the largest rail vehicle contracts in North America, 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars and 182 Flexity Freedom light rail vehicles, for the Toronto Transit Commission, and MetroLinx, a regional transit authority in the Greater Toronto Area. Bombardier split construction of these vehicles between its Ciudad Sahagún factory, and one of its factories in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Welding the basic chassis was to take place in the Ciudad Sahagún factory. Bombardier fell years behind in delivery of these vehicles. Reports in the Canadian press repeated claims that the workers in the Thunder Bay plant that the work done in Ciudad Sahagún was not competently performed. Bombardier tried to speed up construction by opening up an additional production line in its plant in Kingston, Ontario. &&&&& &&&&& The ''Financial Post'' reported, in January 2015, that Bombardier's Thunder Bay plant blamed layoffs on Bombardier Ciudad Sahagún's delays in delivery. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

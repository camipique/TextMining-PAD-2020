Angeles (band) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Angeles''' is an American rock band from Los Angeles, United States, formed in 1977 by Dale Lytle. They were signed to Mystic Records, who released their debut album in 1984. As of 2018, Angeles have released eleven albums. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& ===Early history and first three albums (1975–1991)=== &&&&& The roots of Angeles can be traced to 1975 when Dale Lytle and Dave Raudman started the band “Avante-Gard”, the band's name was changed to “English” in 1976, before finally settling with “Angeles” in mid-1977. The initial line-up of Angeles was a five-piece: Dale Lytle on guitar, Dave Raudman on vocals, Terrell Hill on drums, Frank Galante on Bass, and Jen Nicia Alcivar on keyboard. On August 1, 1981, Angeles and Motley Crue co-headlined two concerts at The Troubadour. After signing to Mystic Records in 1984, they released their debut album ''We're no Angels''; ''Hit Parader'' described the album as "a tight powerful collection of metal anthems" that "manages to elicit plenty of excitement on tracks such as 'Nasty Girls' and 'No Sugar Tonight'." In 1984, Angeles opened up for Bon Jovi at the Reseda Country Club. By 1988, Angeles had shared the stage with Guns N' Roses, Metallica, and Motley Crue. The band broke up in 1991, after releasing three albums. &&&&& &&&&& ===Reunion and recent activities (1996-present)=== &&&&& &&&&& In 1996, Angeles reformed with new singer Brian LeBoeuf. Their fourth album, ''No Limits'', was their first release in eight years. &&&&& &&&&& On January 2013, while playing a Make-A-Wish Foundation benefit concert, Angeles was joined onstage by Gary Richrath who was best known as the lead guitarist and a songwriter for the band REO Speedwagon from 1970 until 1989. On January 22, 2014, Denise Fallon Naccarato, the singer of Angeles, was killed in a motorcycle accident. Less than two years later, Angeles' drummer of 25 years, John Merritt, was killed in an automobile accident as well. &&&&& &&&&& In 2016, Angeles signed with Rock Avenue Records USA, releasing ''Crazy'' and ''Killers of the Game'' to international audiences. Angeles was featured in the 2016 documentary ''Inside Metal: LA Metal Scene Explodes'' which covers the era from 1981 to 1986 when local hard rock and metal bands rose to prominence in Los Angeles. Angeles is currently signed to Bongo Boy Records. On December 28, 2018, Rix Fox made his bass playing debut with the band at the Whisky A Go-Go; he parted with the band shortly after. &&&&& &&&&& Discography &&&&& &&&&& * ''We're no Angeles'' (1984) &&&&& * ''Give it up'' (1986) &&&&& * ''Delivering the Goods'' (1989) &&&&& * ''No Limits'' (1997) &&&&& * ''Miracles'' (2007) &&&&& * ''Seriously Fun'' (2014) &&&&& * ''Wild Ride'' (2015) &&&&& * ''Crazy'' (2016) &&&&& * ''Killers of the Game'' (2017) &&&&& * ''Test of Time'' (2018) &&&&& * ''Time of Truth'' (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Band members &&&&& &&&&& '''Current members''' &&&&& * Dale Lytle – guitar (1977–1991, 1997–present) &&&&& * Danny Basulto – drums (2015–present) &&&&& * Danny Ferreira - vocals (2018–present) &&&&& * Rob Saranpa - bass (2019–present) &&&&& &&&&& '''Former members''' &&&&& * Dave Raudman – lead vocals (1977–1991) &&&&& * Frank Galante - bass (1977–1979) &&&&& * Tom Leslie – bass, backing vocals &&&&& * Terell Hill - drums (1977-1979) &&&&& * Tony Casella - drums (1977) &&&&& * Paul DelBoccio - drums (1980-1983) &&&&& * John Merritt – drums, backing vocals (died 2015) &&&&& * John Azar – bass, backing vocals &&&&& * A.J.

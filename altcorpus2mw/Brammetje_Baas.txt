Brammetje Baas &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Brammetje Baas''' is a 2012 Dutch film, directed by Anna van der Heide, based on a picture book written by Tamara Bos, who also wrote the scripts for the film. &&&&& &&&&& Story &&&&& &&&&& Brammetje Baas (nicknamed Bram) moves to Class 3 (''Group'' 3 in Netherlands). He is intelligent and keeps a note of discoveries he makes in his daily life. He also has a separate notebook for recording difficult words, all numbered in an orderly manner. &&&&& &&&&& He cannot sit still and concentrate on tasks that he has to do at school. This has created tension with his teacher Mr. Vis (Ren√© Groothof). He also saves a fly (whose "compound eyes" formed one of the inventions in Bram's collection) that Mr. Vis wanted to kill . He catches it with a glass and sets it free outside. For so doing he gets a punishment because he should have stayed sitting at his desk. &&&&& &&&&& Bram wants to invent a rocket bus later on. His mother tells him that he must be able to count well, which motivates him to do his best to learn his sums. &&&&& &&&&& One day Bram climbs on a cupboard, whereupon Mr. Vis tries to pull him off.... and a "'''gecompliceerde beenbreuk'''" (a word combination that Bram adds to his collection: meaning "complicated bone fracture") occurs. It was suggested that Bram would be better off going to another school. Bram's parents sometimes get into arguments about how to deal with him. He is "schoolziek" (again a word for his collection : meaning "sick of school"). Later that day he wanders away and is found in a park. &&&&& &&&&& Then another teacher, Mr. Mark (Egbert Jan Weeber), replaces Mr. Vis. He has a better understanding of children who cannot sit still for long. He sometimes lets them walk around in the classroom. &&&&& &&&&& Later, Mr. Vis returns. Things were getting better now. Brammetje said sorry to Master Vis (although according to Brammetje it was not his fault that he fell). Now he may occasionally bring stuff to classrooms, or run for a while outside. &&&&& &&&&& In English &&&&& &&&&& The film is dubbed in English under the name, '''Fridgety Bram'''. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Actor &&&&& &&&&& Role &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Brammetje Baas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Meester Peer Vis &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Moeder Els Baas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Kimmetje Baas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Vader Jaap Baas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Meester Mark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Liselore Lusjes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& *http://www.brammetjebaas.nl &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Barton reviewed ''Amycus Probe'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 47. Barton commented that "I recommend that if ''Amycus Probe'' is used, it be used in the campaign version and not as a one-time scenario. Provided that the latter adventures in the series carry through on the theme, it could form the basis of an interesting campaign situation." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

89	Chinlestegophis
Chinlestegophis &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Chinlestegophis''''', a putative Triassic stereospondyl considered to be related to metoposauroids such as ''Rileymillerus'', is an extinct genus of possible stereospondylian and has been noted to share many features with caecilians, a living group of legless burrowing amphibians. If ''Chinlestegophis'' is indeed both an advanced stereospondyl and a relative of caecilians, this means that stereospondyls (in the form of caecilians) survived to the present day. ''Chinlestegophis jenkinsi'', the type and only species, is known from two partial skulls discovered in the Chinle Formation in Colorado. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ant-Man and the Wasp (soundtrack) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Ant-Man and the Wasp (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)''''' is the film score for the Marvel Studios film ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''. The score was composed by Christophe Beck. Hollywood Records released the album digitally on July 6, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& In June 2017, ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' director Peyton Reed confirmed that Christophe Beck, who composed the score for ''Ant-Man'', would return for ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''. Beck reprised his main theme from ''Ant-Man'', and also wrote a new one for Hope van Dyne / Wasp that he wanted to be "high energy" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Scott Lang / Ant-Man. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be "enough newness in the score to feel like it’s going new places, and isn’t just some retread." Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All music composed by Christophe Beck. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Additional music &&&&& One additional song, "Come On Get Happy" by The Partridge Family, is featured in the film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. &&&&& Another song found in the film, "Everyday is like Sunday" by Morrissey, was not included on the soundtrack album. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

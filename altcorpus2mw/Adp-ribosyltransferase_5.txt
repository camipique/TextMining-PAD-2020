94	Adp-ribosyltransferase_5
Adp-ribosyltransferase 5 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''ADP-ribosyltransferase 5''' is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ART5 gene. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Function &&&&& &&&&& The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ARG-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase family. Proteins in this family regulate the function of target proteins by attaching ADP-ribose to specific amino acid residues in their target proteins. The mouse homolog lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor signal sequence and is predicted to be a secretory enzyme. Several transcripts encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

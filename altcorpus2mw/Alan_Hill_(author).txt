Alan Hill (author) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Alan Hill''' (born in 1928) has been a prominent biographer of cricketers since 1978. He has won The Cricket Society/MCC Book of the Year award twice: in 1986 for ''Hedley Verity: A Portrait of a Cricketer'', and in 1991 for ''Herbert Sutcliffe: Cricket Maestro''. &&&&& &&&&& Reviewing ''Herbert Sutcliffe'' in ''Wisden'', John Arlott called Hill's biographies "distinguished", "right in subject, treatment and content", and added: "Mr Hill's style is both balanced and unfussy; he knows when to state and when to quote ... he constantly leads the reader to think, thus heightening both his concentration and his interest." Reviewing ''Daring Young Men'' for Cricinfo, Rob Steen called Hill "a nostalgist of occasional elegance and vast industry". In ''Wisden'' in 2003 Frank Keating said, "Down the years, the diligent cuttings-librarian Hill has been a productive cottage industry, doing the game proud with a succession of fond and important studies". &&&&& &&&&& Alan Hill lives and works in the Mid Sussex village of Lindfield. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& * ''The Family Fortune: A Saga of Sussex Cricket'' (1978) &&&&& * ''A Chain of Spin Wizards'' (1983) &&&&& * ''Hedley Verity: A Portrait of a Cricketer'' (1986) &&&&& * ''Johnny Wardle: Cricket Conjuror'' (1988) &&&&& * ''Les Ames'' (1990) &&&&& * ''Herbert Sutcliffe: Cricket Maestro'' (1991) &&&&& * ''Bill Edrich: A Biography'' (1994) &&&&& * ''Peter May: The Authorised Biography'' (1996) &&&&& * ''Jim Laker: A Biography'' (1998) &&&&& * ''The Bedsers: Twinning Triumphs'' (2001) &&&&& * ''Brian Close: Cricket's Lionheart'' (2002) &&&&& * ''Daring Young Men: The Story of England's Victorious Tour of Australia and New Zealand, 1954-55'' (2005) &&&&& * ''Tony Lock: Aggressive Master of Spin'' (2008) &&&&& * ''The Valiant Cricketer: The Biography of Trevor Bailey'' (2012) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

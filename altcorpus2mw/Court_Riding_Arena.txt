Court Riding Arena &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Court Riding Arena''' is a building of the historical significance in Pushkin, Saint Petersburg. It was built in 1786, and rebuilt in 1819. Nowadays it is an object of cultural heritage. The building is located on 16 Sadovaya Street. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The first building of the arena at the present place was a wooden one, erected in the middle of the 18th century under the project of SI Chevakinsky. The stone building was built in 1786-1788 on the project of IV Neelov. The building quickly deteriorated. VP Stasov, who was entrusted with repairs, instead planned a complete reorganization, retaining only part of the walls and increasing the building. Restructuring was completed by November 1819, from September 1820 the court arena was used. It was intended for horse exercises by the officers of the retinue and the imperial convoy, and also by regiments of the Imperial Guard, which were quartered in Tsarskoe Selo. &&&&& &&&&& After the October Revolution in the arena was the People's Theater (in it, in particular, spoke FI Shalyapin), later there were mechanical workshops, and since 1949 - the gym. Currently it continues to host sporting events. Restoration was carried out in 1951 and in 2010. &&&&& &&&&& Architecture &&&&& The court arena is an extended one-story building. In the center is a Doric portico of 8 columns, grouped in two (it was preserved from the construction of Neelov, although Stasov reduced the height of the pediment). On the ends of the longitudinal facades are loggias. The windows after the restructuring of Stasov became semi-circular, lacking platbands. At the front facades, attics were made, but they did not survive. The facades are decorated with a frieze with trigrams. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

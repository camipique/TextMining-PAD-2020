116	Agaresuchus
Agaresuchus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Agaresuchus''''' is an extinct genus of allodaposuchid once known as "''Allodaposuchus''" ''subjuniperus''. &&&&& &&&&& In 2013 a second species of ''Allodaposuchus'', ''A. subjuniperus'', was named on the basis of a skull from the late-Maastrichtian Conqu√®s Formation, part of the Tremp Group, in the province of Huesca, Spain. The skull was found underneath a juniper tree whose roots had grown between the bones, hence the species name ''subjuniperus'' or "under juniper" in Latin. In 2016, the species was renamed to ''Agaresuchus subjuniperus'' The 2013 study also proposed that the French and Spanish fossils assigned to ''A. precedens'' in 2001 might actually represent a new unnamed species of ''Allodaposuchus'' currently identified as ''Allodaposuchus'' sp. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

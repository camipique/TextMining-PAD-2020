Ammoselinum butleri &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Ammoselinum butleria''''', commonly called the '''Butler's sandparsley''', is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is native to the United States, where it is found primarily in the South Central region. It is most often found in disturbed sandy areas, including lawns. Its range has expanded eastward in recent times, leading some authorities to consider populations east of the Mississippi River to be non-native. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Ammoselinum butleri'' is small annual, usually reaching no more than high (rarely up to ). It has leaves that are decompound, and divided into linear segments. It blooms in the spring, where it produces small umbels of flowers in the axils of stem leaves. In contrast to the similar ''Ammoselinum popei'', the fruits of ''Ammoselinum butleri'' are nearly smooth. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

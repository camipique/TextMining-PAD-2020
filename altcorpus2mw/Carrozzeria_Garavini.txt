Carrozzeria Garavini &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Garavani &&&&& Bianchi S9 ambulance by Garavani &&&&& '''Carrozzeria Garavini''' was an Italian coachbuilding company based in Turin, Italy &&&&& History &&&&& The Carrozzeria Garavini was founded in Turin in 1908 by Eusebio Garavini under the name "Carrozzeria Piemonte". &&&&& &&&&& Eusebio Garavini was born in 1881. In 1899 he was worker for Diatto company. And in 1908 he managed to tie co-work agreement with Diatto. In the first years of activity he set up exclusively the frames produced by the Diatto and soon the two companies merged into the "Diatto and Garavini". In 1914 the "Garavini SA" was born, followed by the "Garavini Carrozzeria Stabilimenti" in 1933. &&&&& &&&&& The company suffered massive damages during the First World War, but managed to build some luxury cars for Itala, Isotta Fraschini, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, OM and Bugatti, as well as numerous ambulances and buses. &&&&& &&&&& In 1927, Garavini patented the "Pluemelastica" and "Plumacciaio" systems, a valid alternative to the famous patent "Weyman elastic body", to solve the problem of the poor rigidity of the frames that, also because of the bad roads, urged the bodywork to the point of injury. It was therefore necessary to anchor the body in an elastic way, also reducing the noise level. &&&&& &&&&& In 1947 Aldo Garavini took over the company after his father's death. Concetrating for buses and despite recognition, orders and awards the Viberti and Garavani stop its work in 1958. &&&&& &&&&& Main car models by Garavini &&&&& &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Saloon &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Spider Albatros &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Sport Bateau &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 &&&&& *Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 &&&&& *Diatto Tipo 30 &&&&& *Fiat 500 &&&&& *Fiat 508 &&&&& *Fiat 508 Balilla &&&&& *Fiat 510 &&&&& *Fiat 514 Victoria &&&&& *Fiat 521 &&&&& *Fiat 525 &&&&& *Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8 &&&&& *Itala Tipo 50 &&&&& *Itala Model 61 &&&&& *Lancia Appia &&&&& *Lancia Artena &&&&& *Lancia Astura &&&&& *Lancia Augusta &&&&& *Rolls Royce New Phantom &&&&& *Rapid Coup√© &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

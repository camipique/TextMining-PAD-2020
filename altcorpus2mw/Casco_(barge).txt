244	Casco_(barge)
Casco (barge) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Cascos''''' are flat-bottomed square-ended barges from the Philippines. They were used mostly to carry cargo along lakes and rivers, and as lighters to transport goods to and from moored ships. They were built similar to a sampan with two detachable masts with junk rigs made of woven fiber. The entire deck is covered almost entirely in removable curving panels. &&&&& &&&&& ''Cascos'' were most prevalent in southern Luzon. Particularly along the Pasig River and Laguna de Bay, as well as in the Manila Bay harbor. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they were often strung together in a train drawn by a steamship (''vapor''). They were used as transport ships by American troops in Laguna de Bay during the Philippine-American War. ''Cascos'' are still used today in fluvial parades. An example is during the celebrations of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia in Naga City, Bicol. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& File:Muelle del Rey, SS Salvadora, and lighters called 'cascos' (Manila, Philippines, 1900).jpg|''Casco'' (foreground) in Manila (c. 1900) &&&&& File:Tagalog Casco barge.jpg|Drawing of a ''casco'' (c. 1906) &&&&& File:A casco (barge) in Manila Bay (1906).jpg|A ''casco'' in Manila Bay in full sail (c. 1906) &&&&& File:Entrance to Laguna de Bay via Pasig River, early 1800s.jpg|An 1855 woodcut with a casco (left) in a woodcut on the entrance to the Pasig River from the Manila Bay &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& *Balangay &&&&& *Garay &&&&& *Guilalo &&&&& *Karakoa &&&&& *Paraw &&&&& *Salambaw &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

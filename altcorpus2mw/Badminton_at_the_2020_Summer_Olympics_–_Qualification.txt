Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& There are 172 quota places available for qualification for '''badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics'''. The Olympic qualification period takes place between April 29, 2019 and April 26, 2020, and the Badminton World Federation rankings list, scheduled to publish on April 30, 2020, will be used to allocate spots. Nations can enter a maximum of two players each in the men's and women's singles, if both are ranked in the world's top 16; otherwise, one quota place until the roster of thirty-eight players has been completed. Similar regulations also apply to the players competing in the doubles, as the NOCs can enter a maximum of two pairs if both are ranked in the top eight, while the remaining NOCs are entitled to one until the quota of 16 highest-ranked pairs is filled. &&&&& &&&&& Qualifying standards &&&&& Qualification of these Games will be based on the BWF Ranking list to be published on April 30, 2020, providing a total of 16 pairs in each doubles event, and an initial allocation of 38 players in each singles event in the following criteria: &&&&& &&&&& *Singles: &&&&& **Ranking 1-16: Players are taken in turn. A NOC may enter up to a maximum of 2 players, provided both are ranked in the top 16. &&&&& **Ranking 17 and below: Players are taken in turn. A NOC may enter a maximum of 1 player. &&&&& *Doubles: &&&&& **Rankings 1–8: Pairs are taken in turn. A NOC may enter up to a maximum of 2 pairs, provided both pairs are ranked in the top 8. &&&&& **Rankings 9 and above: Pairs are taken in turn. A NOC may enter a maximum of 1 pair. &&&&& &&&&& Each of the five continental confederations will be guaranteed at least one entry in each singles and doubles event (this is called the Continental Representation Place system). If this has not been satisfied by the entry selection method described above, the highest ranked player or pair from the respective continent will qualify. An NOC can qualify players or pairs in a maximum of two events through the Continental Representation Place system; if a NOC qualifies for more than two events through the Continental Representation Place system, the NOC must choose which of them are qualified, and the quota place declined will be offered to the next NOC's eligible player or pair. &&&&& &&&&& Host nation Japan is entitled to enter a male and a female badminton player in each of the singles tournaments, but more than two players may be permitted if they achieve the qualifying regulations. Meanwhile, six quota places are made available to eligible NOCs through the Tripartite Commission Invitation, with three each in the men's and women's singles. The Tripartite Commission invitation places count for the Continental Representation Place system. &&&&& &&&&& For any player who qualifies in both a doubles event and a singles event, an unused quota place will be allocated to the next best ranked eligible athlete of a respective gender in the singles events on the BWF Ranking List as of April 30, 2020. This ensures that a total of 86 men and 86 women qualify, with the individual event fields expanding from 38 to accommodate additional players. &&&&& &&&&& Summary &&&&& &&&&& <!-- &&&&& Qualified players &&&&& &&&&& ===Men's singles=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Player &&&&& &&&&& NOC &&&&& &&&&& Remark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Women's singles=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Player &&&&& &&&&& NOC &&&&& &&&&& Remark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Men's doubles=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Players &&&&& &&&&& NOC &&&&& &&&&& Remark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Women's doubles=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Players &&&&& &&&&& NOC &&&&& &&&&& Remark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Mixed doubles=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Players &&&&& &&&&& NOC &&&&& &&&&& Remark &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& --> &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

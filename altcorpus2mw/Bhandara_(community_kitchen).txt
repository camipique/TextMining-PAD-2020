Bhandara (community kitchen) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Bhandara''' is the term used mostly in Hindu caste and some other communities to describe the free meal served to the people invited to the temple. Food is cooked and served to the people sitting right outside the temple. Usually this is done on festival occasions as a part of worshipping the lord. &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& It is a marathi word in origin but is being used in other languages also. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Bhandara is actually a district in Maharashtra which is known as the “Rice bowl of the country”. Practice of bhandara is mostly done by rich people as an offering to the god they worship. It can also be organized by any individual (referred to as the yajamana) who wishes to worship the lord. This practice was first started by the founder of the sikh religion. After performing the rituals and worshipping the almighty, the yajamana serves food to the poor and the needy. Bhog usually called khichdi-a dish made up of rice and moong daal are served to the people. Bhandara is also organized to celebrate a birthdays, anniversaries or weddings and to commemorate the death of the departed. &&&&& &&&&& The indian government has introduced a scheme known as ‘'Seva Bhoj Yojna’' to reimburse the government share of the Central Goods and Services Tax and the Integrated Goods and Service Tax for purchases by religious institutions of certain products for providing free meals. It will cover the raw ingredients of meals and is expected to cost a total of Rs. 325.00 Crores in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. To qualify, an institution will need to serve food free of charge to over 5000 people in the year. &&&&& &&&&& Contemporary developments &&&&& A number of ashrams across India, specially in Haridwar and Rishikesh , bhandaras are offered on a daily basis to the devotees and other poor people. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Langar (Sikhism) &&&&& *Prasāda &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

She coauthored a 2013 book with former CEO and Republican gubernatorial candidate Giovanni Feroce, entitled ''Path of Life: Why I Wear My Alex and Ani''. In an interview, McKenna described the book as based on feedback from customers, saying, "We have one customer in TN whose son was getting treatments at a New England Childrenâ€™s Hospital. As a Mom, our bangles had real healing properties for both her son and her, and it was stories like this one that became the impetus to write the book." &&&&& &&&&& === Buddy Cianci mayoral campaign, 2014 === &&&&& McKenna was named campaign manager for former mayor Buddy Cianci's final campaign for mayor of Providence. McKenna was hired along with former Cianci staffers Charles Mansolillo and Beryl Kenyon. Of Cianci, McKenna said, "I believe in Buddy and everything he's done for Providence, and his leadership now is what is needed to take Providence to the next level." &&&&& &&&&& The Providence Journal reported that the Cianci campaign paid McKenna in 2014 at an address in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to campaign finance reports that showed 11 checks sent to that address between August and November 2014. &&&&& &&&&& === Pawtucket Red Sox stadium campaign, 2015 === &&&&& McKenna served as spokesperson and community outreach director for the Pawtucket Red Sox ownership group during their 2015 campaign to build a new stadium on Providence's waterfront.

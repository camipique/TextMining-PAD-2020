Bryan Jared Kramer &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bryan Jared Kramer''' is a Papua New Guinea politician and Member of the 10th Parliament of Papua New Guinea. He is also a businessman, investigative journalist, and social media strategist. Formerly of the Pangu Party, he founded the Allegiance Party, of which he is the sole MP, in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& Kramer attended Madang International Primary School from 1980 - 1988, and then attended St. Brendan's College, Yeppoon, in Queensland, Australia, until 1992. He finished Year 12 at Divine Word University, Madang, and graduated with a diploma in business and a degree in accounting, also from Divine Word University, in 1999. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Kramer started his career in private enterprise, based in his hometown of Madang. After a range of entrepreneurial activity, including founder and manager of a local nightclub, he contested the seat of Madang Open in the 2007 Papua New Guinea election, at the age of 31. Kramer polled seventh, with 2,644 votes, but continued to run and won the seat in the 2017 Papua New Guinea elections as a member of Pangu Party (Pangu Pati), led by Sam Basil, with a majority of 21,248 votes. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill formed government, with members of Pangu Pati and some other political parties forming opposition. &&&&& &&&&& In September 2017 Basil and some other Pangu Pati members moved to join the O'Neill Government, causing a split as Kramer and four other Pangu Pati members (including former Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta) chose to remain in opposition. Kramer formally announced his resignation from Pangu Pati in March 2018, signalling that he intended to launch a new party called the Allegiance Party. Kramer holds the position of Shadow Minister for Public Enterprises and State Investments and Public Service in the opposition led by Patrick Pruaitch. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2018 Kramer formally registered the Allegiance Party. Kramer is the only Member of Parliament for the Allegiance Party. &&&&& &&&&& In June 2018 Kramer launched an offensive against Papua New Guinea's daily newspapers, ''The National'' and ''Post-Courier''. He called for a boycott to protest corruption and their support for the O'Neill Government. It has prompted a rebuke from the Media Council of Papua New Guinea. &&&&& &&&&& In October 2018, Kramer was part of an opposition-led national strike over the purchase of a fleet of Maserati and Bentley cars by the PNG Government for use as PNG hosted the final events of APEC Papua New Guinea 2018. The incident, which became known as Maseratigate, received international attention and ongoing coverage, particularly after it was revealed a number of vehicles procured for APEC had subsequently gone missing. &&&&& &&&&& In February 2019, Kramer released an analysis of costs related to the destruction of PNG Parliament Haus property by security personnel shortly after APEC activities ended. Immediate estimates of the costs were up to PGK15 million. Kramer's analysis of costs once details were released suggested inflated contracts were being given to businesses with Government connections. &&&&& &&&&& Blogs and writing &&&&& Kramer publishes Facebook blog The Kramer Report. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

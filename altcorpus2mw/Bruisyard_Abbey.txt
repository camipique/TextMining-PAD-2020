Bruisyard Abbey &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Bruisyard Hall, built out of the remains of the conventual buildings. &&&&& The '''Abbey of Bruisyard''' was a house of Minoresses (Poor Clares) at Bruisyard in Suffolk. It was founded from Campsey Priory on the initiative of Maud of Lancaster, assisted by her son-in-law Lionel of Antwerp, in 1364-1366. &&&&& &&&&& The foundation of a religious house at Rokes Hall in Bruisyard began a little earlier, when a small college of secular priests (four chaplains and a master, or warden) attached to Campsey Priory for the purposes of a chantry, established in 1346-1347, was moved to Bruisyard in 1354 to celebrate there in a new chapel of the Annunciation to the Virgin. At that time a full set of statutes was promulgated by Maud of Lancaster. &&&&& &&&&& It was following the death of her daughter Elizabeth de Burgh in 1363 that Lionel of Antwerp assisted in the refoundation of the house as a nunnery under the order of St Clare, and at that time Maud of Lancaster, who had become a canoness at Campsey, transferred to the Poor Clares and spent her last years at Bruisyard. She and her daughter Maud de Ufford were buried there. &&&&& &&&&& The house was suppressed on 17 February 1539. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

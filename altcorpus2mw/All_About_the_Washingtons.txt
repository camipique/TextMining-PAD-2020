On March 17, 2017, following ABC's decision not to move forward with a pilot, it was reported that Amblin Television and ABC Studios had decided to use the penalty money received from ABC to finance a pilot presentation of the production. A truncated version of the pilot script was expected to be used and the episode was set to be filmed at the beginning of April 2017, on the set of ABC Studios’ ''Black-ish'', with Don Scardino directing. &&&&& &&&&& On November 17, 2017, it was announced that Netflix had given the production a straight-to-series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 40% approval rating, with an average rating of 4.07 out of 10 based on 5 reviews. &&&&& &&&&& In an unfavorable review, ''The Hollywood Reporter''s Daniel Fienberg commented that the series proves that reality stars do not necessarily possess the talent necessary to act saying, "the show is built exclusively on the idea that people who are funny in reality can be made to be fictionally funny. In this case, they cannot." In another adverse critique, ''Now''s Rachna Raj Kaur compared the series unfavorably to the Simmons' real-life personas saying, "Rev Run's bold presence in pop-culture has spanned four decades, but his new family sitcom, ''All About The Washingtons'' falls flat. What is arguably one of hip-hop's longest standing royal families, has been compressed to one shallow dimension in this autobiographical sitcom." In a further unfriendly assessment, ''Paste''s Jacob Oller gave the series a grade of 4.2 out of 10 and commented, "''All About the Washingtons'' is simply too facile to be funny and too invested in testing the Simmons with scripted material to be charming. The leads are dull and the lines they shout are either monotonous dad jokes, simple plot points, or loving reconciliations (after no major drama has occurred)." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

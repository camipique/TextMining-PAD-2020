A sister show, called Design Miami Basel, was launched in Switzerland and is also held yearly. As director, Medda created partnerships with notable galleries, collectors and companies, bringing together the international design community. After stepping down, she continued to sit on committees and acted as a creative consultant for the fair. About her contributions to Design Miami, Medda has stated, "I felt honoured, and I feel still honoured, that I can contribute to the cultural fabric of the world I live in". &&&&& &&&&& In 2013, Medda co-founded an e-commerce design website named L’ArcoBaleno, meaning "rainbow" in Italian. The site, which sold collectible design from around the world, featured social media and video content, as well as collaborations with David Adjaye, Tom Dixon and Reed Krakoff. &&&&& In 2015, Medda became Global Creative Director of the "20/21 Design" department at Christies. Her department focused on auctioning design objects, such as furniture and lighting, from the 20th and 21th century.

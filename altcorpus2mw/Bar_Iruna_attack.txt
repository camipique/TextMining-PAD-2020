Bar Iruna attack &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& On December 26, 1987, a bomb attack on a United Service Organizations (USO) club in Barcelona, Spain killed an American sailor and injured nine others. The attack, on ''Bar Iruna'', was perpetrated by Catalan nationalist terrorists. 22-year-old Ronald Strong from Reeders, Pennsylvania was the person who died, having received shrapnel wounds to his lungs and kidneys. &&&&& &&&&& Both Terra Lliure and Catalan Red Liberation Army (ERCA) claimed responsibility. Residents claimed that anti-American slogans and graffiti near the bar at the time suggested the incident was linked to the extension of the Spain-United States military treaty (Pact of Madrid), which was first signed during the tenure of ''caudillo'' Francisco Franco in 1953. &&&&& &&&&& Terra Lliure had previously claimed responsibility for an attack on an American consulate in Barcelona in October, which wounded eight sailors. A woman claiming to be from ERCA took responsibility "against an establishment of the Yankee war marines" in a call to news agency EFE. However, the authorities doubted its credibility. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *1985 El Descanso bombing &&&&& *1988 Naples bombing &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&

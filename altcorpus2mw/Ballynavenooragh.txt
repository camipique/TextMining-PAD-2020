178	Ballynavenooragh
Ballynavenooragh &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ballynavenooragh''' () () is a stone fort and National Monument located in County Kerry, Ireland. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& &&&&& Ballynavenooragh lies on the Dingle Peninsula, north of Dingle town, on the western slopes of Mount Brandon. The broader Ballynavenooragh group comprises 40 ringforts, 24 clocháns and 2 cillíní. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& This cashel (stone fort, internal diameter) was in use in the 7th–10th centuries, with later reuse in the 13th century. It is similar to the cashel at Leacanabuaile. &&&&& &&&&& It was excavated by Erin Gibbons in the late 1990s. A pit containing organic remains was found — apple, blackberry, hazelnut and grape seeds. Also found were stone tools, pottery, iron knives, a blue glass bead, crucible fragments, two 13th-century coins (silver pennies of Henry III) and two lathe-turned objects. Alder and willow were used for posts, apparently due to a lack of oak in the region. &&&&& &&&&& Structures &&&&& &&&&& The cashel contains two clocháns, a fireplace, souterrain and several postholes, and stepped terracing. The gateposts are formed by upright slabs. An oblong chamber in the souterrain is long. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

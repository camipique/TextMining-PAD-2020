Arkansas Highway 250 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Highway 250''' ('''AR 250''', '''Ark. 250''', and '''Hwy. 250''') is an east–west state highway in Scott County, Arkansas. The highway begins near Waldron and runs east into the Ouachita National Forest. The route is maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). &&&&& &&&&& Route description &&&&& Highway 250 near the western terminus &&&&& Highway 250 begins at U.S. Highway 71 Business (US 71B) south of Waldron in Southwest Arkansas. It runs east through a sparsely populated rural area before entering the Ouachita National Forest. The route runs east, paralleling Dutch Creek until an intersection with Highway 80, where it terminates. &&&&& &&&&& The ArDOT maintains Highway 250 like all other parts of the state highway system.

ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2016, the highway was estimated to have 320 vehicles per day (VPD). Highways under 400 VPD are classified as very low volume local road by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). &&&&& &&&&& No segment of Highway 250 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. &&&&& &&&&& Major intersections &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Highway 250 was created on July 10, 1957 by the Arkansas State Highway Commission during a period of expansion in the state highway system.

Pleased with the functioning of the school the parents urged to continue the school as co-ed and further including higher grades, which was however declined. &&&&& &&&&& Sam and Nathalie Brown approached Bishop Stephen Bayne of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia who directed them to take the plan forward. They along with other interested parents purchased 127 acres on Chambers Creek Road and began functioning as a private boys school as approved by Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Their first year in 1957 included 40 boys and five faculties. In 1970, Charles Wright Academy decided to admit girls and has been co-ed ever since.

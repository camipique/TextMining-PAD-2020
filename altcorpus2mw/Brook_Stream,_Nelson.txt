Brook Stream, Nelson &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Brook Stream''' / Waimarama is a major tributary of the Maitai / Mahitahi River in Nelson, South Island, New Zealand. &&&&& &&&&& Nelson's first water scheme was on Brook Stream, with a weir and pipeline constructed in 1867 in what is now the Brook Waimarama Sanctuary. Demand began to exceed supply, and a second weir was constructed to create the Top Dam in 1909. By the 1930s it was insufficient for Nelsonâ€™s growing population. The Roding River waterworks scheme was completed in 1941 and an intake on the Maitai Mahitahi South Branch completed in 1963. The Brook Dam was decommissioned in 2000. &&&&& &&&&& Restoration of Brook Stream, and waterways in the Maitai catchment, has been a major focus of Project Maitai, a Nelson City Council initiative to improve the health of the Maitai River and all its tributaries. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

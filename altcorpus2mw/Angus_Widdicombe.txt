His senior club rowing was initially from the Barwon Rowing Club in Geelong and then from Melbourne's Mercantile Rowing Club. &&&&& &&&&& In Mercantile club eights Widdicombe contested the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in 2014 and 2015. In Mercantile colours he contested national titles at the Australian Rowing Championships.

He contested further King's Cups in the white V in 2017 and 2018. &&&&& &&&&& International representative rowing &&&&& Widdicombe made his Australian representative debut at the 2016 World Rowing U23 Championships in Rotterdam in the Australian U23 eight which raced to a seventh place finish. &&&&& &&&&& The following year Widdicombe was tested in various sweep-oared boats in the international season of the Australian senior squad. He raced in the eight to a fourth place at the World Rowing Cup II in Poznan and in a coxless four at the WRC III in Lucerne. Then at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in Sarasota and teamed with Darcy Wruck, Widdicombe rowed a coxed pair bearing James Rook up front, to a silver medal. &&&&& &&&&& Widdicome was again in the Australian squad for their 2018 international tour. He rowed in the eight to a fifth placing at the World Rowing Cup II in Linz, Austria. In the touring party's second regatta of the 2018 season at the Henley Royal Regatta Widdicombe and Campbell Watts achieved the final of the Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup for the men’s pair and took on the champion Croatian brothers Martin and Valent Sinković, Olympic double-sculls champions then presenting their world class credentials as a pair. It was a convincing win for the Croatians. The following week at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne, Widdicombe stroked the Australian eight to silver medal in a thrilling 0.14 second finish behind Germany. The stage was set for the close competition that played out at the 2018 World Championships in Plovdiv. In their heat the Australian eight finished 5/100ths of a second behind the USA and then in the final, Germany dominated and took gold but 2/10ths of a second separated 2nd through to 4th and the Australians with Widdicombe setting the pace took silver, a bowball ahead of Great Britain with the USA just another bowball behind but out of the medals. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Alfred Cadart &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Etching of Cadart by Marcellin Desboutin. &&&&& '''Alfred Cadart''' (1828–1875) was a French printer, writer and publisher, most notable for his major part in the etching revival in 19th-century France. He played a key role in the revival and sale of etchings in France and beyond. As founder of the French Société des Aquafortistes, he combined strategic understanding with a passion for the artistic qualities of the etching. &&&&& &&&&& His efforts to promote the art of etching did not bring him financial success, but he did help develop the infrastructure for original printmaking that emerged in the 1890s. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& He was born in Saint-Omer to a hotelier and began his working life in the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord. He married the sister of François Chifflart, a painter. He made contact with emerging realist artists such as Alphonse Legros and François Bonvin and later published several plates after paintings by Gustave Courbet. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ''Tome 1 : L'eau-forte de peintre au XIXe siècle : la société des aquafortistes. 1862-1867 ; Tome 2 : Dictionnaire de la Société des aquafortistes'', Paris, Éditions Léonce Laget, 1972. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Anxious Sunday &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Anxious Sunday''''' () is a 1983 disaster film directed by Rudolf Fruntov. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& A Liberian tanker called "Ghent" is moored in the port of a Black Sea city. A repair team is sent to the ship, consisting of three experienced locksmiths and a young trainee, to repair a minor malfunction. During the repair, a fire breaks out aboard the ship that leaves the workers and mechanics trapped in the ship's hold. The locksmiths and the mechanic are experienced men and surround the intern with care and support. When he faints, they gently hold him in their arms. However, the spill of oil threatens to ignite and cause catastrophe for the entire port. To help the local firefighters, a convoy of fire trucks from Belodolsk is dispatched, but the road to it is blocked by a heavy panel truck that has turned over due to a dangerous maneuver performed by the driver. &&&&& &&&&& The Soviet firefighters who arrive have the difficult task of rescuing the men from the ship. The head of the fire detachment, Lieutenant Colonel Chagin, makes a risky decision to blow up the ship's side in order to straighten the dangerous tilt of the ship. The fire is followed by the chairman of the city executive committee, Anna Golovina, whose son is one of the workers trapped in the hold. Having learned about this, she decides not to disclose this but is engaged in the evacuation of children's institutions. Captain Zemtsov, experiencing a family drama, makes his way to the workers locked in the hold. Learning that Golovin is ill, he uses a device and gets on the deck of the ship, but, after being poisoned due to smoke, Captain Zemtsov loses consciousness. He is taken out and taken to the hospital. Chagin pierces the broadside straightening the bank. The arriving Belodolsky convoy begins a successful foam attack, extinguishes the fire on the ship and saves all the blocked workers. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& *Klara Luchko — Anna Golovina, the chairman of the city executive committee &&&&& *Emmanuil Vitorgan — Igor Chagin, lieutenant colonel of internal service, chief of the fire brigade &&&&& *Aleksandr Belyavsky — Major of Internal Service Istomin, Deputy of Chagin &&&&& *Sergey Martynov — Sergey, foreman of ship repair workers &&&&& *George Korolchuk — captain of Zemtsov's internal service, the operative on duty of the fire brigade &&&&& *Ruben Simonov — Karen Maloyan, Port Fire Officer &&&&& *Tatyana Tashkova — Tanya Zemtsova &&&&& *Tatyana Bozhok — Lena Chagina &&&&& *Vsevolod Safonov — Monsieur Marcinel, the captain of the tanker "GENT" &&&&& *Sergei Balabanov — Konstantin Vyalikh, son of Golovinoy &&&&& *Viktor Zozulin — Paul Namur, tanker mechanic "GENT" &&&&& *Lev Polyakov — Chyolobov, the chief of the port fire protection &&&&& *Alexander Yanvaryov — Peter Gontar, ship repairman &&&&& *Romualdas Ramanauskas — member of a foreign delegation &&&&& *Olga Kataeva — Kira, sergeant of internal service, mistress of Chagin &&&&& *Viktor Kosykh — Kolya, ship repairman &&&&& *Vladimir Litvinov — navigator of the tanker "GENT" &&&&& *Mikhail Bocharov — on duty at the fire station &&&&& *Inna Vykhodtseva — head of a kindergarten &&&&& *Daniil Netrebin — Colonel of Internal Service Komigin, Head of the Fire Department of the Department of Internal Affairs &&&&& *Olga Sirina — Karen's wife &&&&& *Victor Shulgin — episode &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

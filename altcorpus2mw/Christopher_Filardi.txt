Christopher Filardi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Christopher Filardi''' ('''Chris Filardi''') is an American evolutionary biologist and ecologist. &&&&& &&&&& Filardi, a 1989 graduate of Bowdoin College, earned his Ph.D. in 2003 from the University of Washington. &&&&& &&&&& As a director at the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s ''Center for Biodiversity and Conservation'', Filardi was an author of the New York Times's "Scientist at Work'' blog; writing about his work in the Solomon Islands. &&&&& &&&&& Filardi was the first scientist to describe and collect a male Moustached Kingfisher. &&&&& &&&&& In the 2010s Filardi was part of a team sponsored by Conservation International and the National Science Foundation to map the process of speciation in the Solomon Islands. The group identified the Solomons frogmouth as a new genus of bird. The team documented the rapid evolution of the Zosteropidae (White-eye,) a bird, into over a hundred species. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014, Filardi co-authored a population study of grizzly bears that was able to use non-invasive methods in keeping with the cultural beliefs and practices of the Heiltsuk Nation to reveal the existence of a much larger population of bears that had been expected in a temperate forest on the central coast of British Columbia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Chris Filardi: ''Scientist at Work'' (New York Times ) &&&&& * Scientist at Work: Chris Filardi (National Science Foundation) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

There was a previous attempt to merge the districts in fall 2016, but voters from Odebolt-Arthur voted it down out of fear that their school would close. There were tensions between the Odebolt-Arthur and Battle Creek-Ida Grove communities. &&&&& By 2018 the merger was approved. The merger took effect July 1 of that year. &&&&& &&&&& Schools &&&&& &&&&& *Battle Creek-Ida Grove High School - Ida Grove &&&&& **It was built in 1971. it had 273 students. &&&&& *Battle Creek-Ida Grove Middle School - Battle Creek &&&&& **It was built in 1960. it had 211 students. &&&&& *Battle Creek Elementary School &&&&& **It was built in 1913. it had 90 students. &&&&& *Ida Grove Elementary School &&&&& **It was built in 1959. it had 284 students. &&&&& &&&&& At one point the elementary levels were consolidated to Ida Grove. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

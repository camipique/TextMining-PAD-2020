Domènec Torrent &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Domènec Torrent Font''' (born 14 July 1962) is a Spanish professional football head coach and former player. He is currently head coach of Major League Soccer's New York City FC. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Born in Santa Coloma de Farners in Girona, Catalonia, he played as a midfielder for UE Olot and AD Guíxols in the 1980s before becoming a coach. He enjoyed periods as head coach of lower division sides Palafrugell, Palamós, and Girona. &&&&& &&&&& After managing Girona, he united with Pep Guardiola as his assistant at Barcelona. The duo initially took charge of Barcelona B, the club's reserve team, before the 2007–08 season. At the time Barcelona B was playing in Spain's fourth division, but under the pair's guidance the team won the 2008 Tercera División play-offs and was promoted to Segunda División B for the 2008–09 season. This success allowed the duo to transition to managing the first team in May 2008, where they stayed until 2012. Torrent remained with Guardiola as the latter moved to Bayern Munich and Manchester City, winning 24 trophies in eleven years together. &&&&& &&&&& On 11 June 2018, citing a desire to return to head coaching, he was named the new head coach at New York City FC, replacing Patrick Vieira. He signed a three year contract through the 2020 season. Torrent was given the position despite no top league managerial experience due to the relationship of New York City FC and Manchester City. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Torrent is the grandson of a former Barcelona player. &&&&& &&&&& Honours &&&&& ===Assistant coach=== &&&&& '''Barcelona B''' &&&&& *'''Tercera División (1)''': 2007–08 &&&&& &&&&& '''Barcelona''' &&&&& *'''La Liga (3)''': 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11 &&&&& *'''Copa del Rey (2)''': 2008–09, 2011–12 &&&&& *'''Supercopa de España (3)''': 2009, 2010, 2011 &&&&& *'''UEFA Champions League (2)''': 2008–09, 2010–11 &&&&& *'''UEFA Super Cup (2)''': 2009, 2011 &&&&& *'''FIFA Club World Cup (2)''': 2009, 2011 &&&&& &&&&& '''Bayern Munich''' &&&&& *'''Bundesliga (3)''': 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16 &&&&& *'''DFB-Pokal (2)''': 2013–14, 2015–16 &&&&& *'''UEFA Super Cup (1)''': 2013 &&&&& *'''FIFA Club World Cup (1)''': 2013 &&&&& &&&&& '''Manchester City''' &&&&& *'''Premier League (1)''': 2017–18 &&&&& *'''EFL Cup (1)''': 2017–18 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Domènec Torrent at BDFútbol &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

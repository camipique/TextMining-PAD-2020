1373	Hoesik
Hoesik &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''''' (, Hanja: , ) is a popular type of gathering in the society of South Korea, and refers to a group of people getting together to eat and drink. In Korean society, Hoesik has been established as a subculture of an organization or enterprise. &&&&& &&&&& Origin &&&&& The origin of the Hoesik was based on the word "Hoe-min" of the Joseon Dynasty. It is said that the word "Hoe-min" was used in order to make the kings and officials of Joseon become 'Let's be one'. It seems that the most likely theory has changed from the word "Hoe-min" to "Hoesik". In this way, Hoesik is not a place for the individual, as it can be interpreted as an interpretation that the king and his subjects should live together and eat together. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& === 1980s~1990s === &&&&& Under the influence of Korean traditional military cultures, those lower than the superior must drink. Binge drinking was mainly encouraged by the 'bomb shot' or 'poktanju,' including beer+spirits and soju+spirits. In the 1990s, however, the campaign for sound drinking started, and the culture to avoid social gatherings spread due to the IMF economic crisis. &&&&& &&&&& === 2000s~the present === &&&&& Companies and organizations are trying to improve their Hoesik culture as a reaction to the prevailing social atmosphere surrounding the issues of 'bombshot', drinking glasses, and sexual harassment. Instead of focusing on just drinking and dancing, other forms of entertainment and cultural gatherings, such as watching movies and bowling are becoming increasingly common. &&&&& &&&&& === Changes in Hoesik with the enactment of the new law === &&&&& Kim Young-ran Act(Korean: 김영란법), also known as the anti-graft law, refers to the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.

And the Me too Movement is changing the Hoesik inside Korean companies. The senior employees that were leading the Hoesik had fewer Hoesik as they left early.

Heavy drinking is a cause of embarrassment to people that are unable to drink well. This is because the boss or other office superiors are present and can witness one's drunken behavior.

The next day's hangover can make them feel very tired and they can not go to work or spend the day in a bad mood. &&&&& &&&&& ==== Forced attendance at hwoesik ==== &&&&& Many company employees are forced to attend, although their attendance is often passive and uncomfortable. Supervisors may lead the conversation while subordinates follow the conversation. &&&&& &&&&& ==== Loss of human relations with late hwoesik ==== &&&&& Most conversations at a hwoesik may be with colleagues and supervisors and focus on company's shortcomings and company gossip.

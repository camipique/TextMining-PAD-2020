In 2007 she completed a PhD in archaeology and art studies at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and in 2011 she completed a PhD in philosophy at Groningen University, entitled ''Through a Mind Darkly: An Empirically-informed philosophical perspective on systematic knowledge acquisition and cognitive limitations'', under the supervision of Igor Douven.

She is currently an Executive Editor of the ''Journal of Analytic Theology'', and a member of the editorial boards of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the ''Journal of Mind & Behavior'', and ''Religious Studies''. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014 De Cruz published a series of interviews with philosophers working outside of academia for the NewAPPS blog. She was a signatory on a 2018 open letter from academic philosophers to Amber Rudd, which urged the then home secretary to reconsider a request for asylum. The letter described a request which had been denied on the grounds that the applicant had not mentioned Plato or Aristotle when asked about humanism. The letter's signatories argued that the applicant should not have been expected to mention them. &&&&& &&&&& In addition to being a prolific philosopher, De Cruz is also a player of the Renaissance lute and a digital artist. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& * (in press).

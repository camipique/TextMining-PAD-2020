Argentina, Kenya, Pakistan, Malaysia, and West Germany boycotted completely, and while Australia, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and New Zealand competed in some sports, their hockey governing bodies pulled out. The organising committee reduced the competition to six teams, with Cuba and Tanzania representing the Americas and Africa in place of Argentina and Kenya respectively, and Poland also drafted in as the next best team from the 1978 World Cup. &&&&& &&&&& Results &&&&& ===Preliminary=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ---- &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ---- &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ---- &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ---- &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Classification=== &&&&& ====Fifth and sixth place==== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ====Bronze Medal Match==== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ====Gold Medal Match==== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Final standings &&&&& # &&&&& # Spain &&&&& # &&&&& # &&&&& # &&&&& # &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official FIH website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

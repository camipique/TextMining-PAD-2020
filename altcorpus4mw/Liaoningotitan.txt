Liaoningotitan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Liaoningotitan''''' is a genus of titanosauriform sauropod from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Distinguishing features of ''Liaoningotitan'' include a ventral margin of the maxilla that is convex, a upper tooth row that is short and anteriorly positioned; an anterior extension of the jugal that nearly reaches the level of the anterior margin of the antorbital fenestra; a basally constricted quadrate wing of the pterygoid; imbricated upper teeth, with narrow spatulate crowns that are D-shaped in cross section, and no labial grooves or denticles; nine reduced and un-imbricated lower teeth; asymmetric lower tooth crowns which are elliptical-like in cross section, with lingual grooves and ridges and a lingually bulbous basal crown; a proximal expansion of the humerus that is about 54.9% the length of the humerus; and an ilium with a pointed preacetabular process. &&&&& &&&&& Classification &&&&& Zhou et al. (2018) recover ''Liaoningotitan'' as a somphospondylan titanosauriform more derived than ''Euhelopus''. &&&&& &&&&& Paleoecology &&&&& ''Liaoningotitan'' is one of two titanosauriforms from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning, the other being ''Dongbeititan''. These two forms co-existed with feathered dinosaurs in the Early Cretaceous lacustrine environment of present-day Liaoning. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Evita Movement &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Evita Movement''' () is a social, piquetero, and union movement, and a political group of Argentina, which is defined by Peronist, national, popular, and revolutionary ideology. It was created in 2004 and was part of the Front for Victory that governed from 2003 to 2015. In 2016 the Evita Movement separated from the parliamentary bloc of the Front for Victory, forming one of its own called Peronism for Victory. Its name was adopted as a tribute to former First Lady Eva Perón. It is a member of the Confederation of Workers of the Popular Economy (CTEP). &&&&& &&&&& Its general secretary is Emilio Pérsico. Other referents of the movement are former minister Jorge Taiana, national deputies Leonardo Grosso (president of the bloc), Silvia Horne, Remo Carlotto, Lucila De Ponti, and Araceli Ferreyra, former senators Juan Manuel Abal Medina Jr. and Teresita Luna, the journalist Fernando "Chino" Navarro, and Evita-CTEP liaison Esteban Castro. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Evita Movement emerged in 2004, as a result of the union of diverse groups from the Quebracho Revolutionary Patriotic Movement and the Anibal Verón Current of Unemployed Workers, with roots mainly in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. &&&&& &&&&& In its first year, the Evita Movement organized itself as a piquetero unemployed movement (MTD), but later redefined its purpose to reorganize itself as a popular revolutionary wing of Kirchnerism, acting with ample autonomy both inside and outside the Justicialist Party (PJ). In 2007 Emilio Pérsico was named secretary of Territorial Organizations of the PJ. One of the unusual characteristics of the Evita Movement is that its electoral secretary has lacked interest in holding political office. &&&&& &&&&& The Evita Movement, like other movements of the unemployed, grants a central role to the organization of its members to work cooperatively, mainly in the construction of popular housing, financed by the state. The popular power policy of the Evita Movement was explained in these terms by one of its members: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& It participated in the 2017 legislative election, joining the Citizen's Unity electoral front. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

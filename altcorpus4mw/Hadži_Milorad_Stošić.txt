Hadži Milorad Stošić &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Hadži Milorad Stošić''' (; born 11 August 1954) is a politician and retired military official in Serbia. He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2012 as a member of the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS). &&&&& &&&&& Early life and military career &&&&& Stošić was born in Dragovac, a village in the municipality of Priština, Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He was raised in the Priština area, attended secondary military school in Belgrade, and subsequently graduated from the Belgrade Military Academy, specializing in telecommunications. &&&&& &&&&& Stošić served in the Yugoslav People's Army and the successor Armed Forces of Yugoslavia and Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro. He was a commander of units and oversaw telecommunications, personnel management, and operational-teaching tasks. He retired on 1 January 2004 with the rank of captain first class and was subsequently appointed as Information Systems Manager at the University of Niš Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Stošić joined the PUPS on its founding in 2005. He is the president of the party's municipal organization in Niš and serves as vice-president on its executive committee. &&&&& &&&&& The PUPS contested the 2007 Serbian parliamentary election in an alliance with the Social Democratic Party, and Stošić received the tenth position on their electoral list. The list did not cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly. From 2008 to 2012, Stošić was a member of the Niš city council (i.e., the executive branch of the municipal government). In July 2012, he represented the PUPS in discussions that led to a new coalition government in the city. &&&&& &&&&& The United Pensioners joined an electoral alliance led by the Socialist Party of Serbia in 2008. Stošić received the thirty-fourth position on the Socialist-led list in the 2012 parliamentary election and was elected when the list won forty-four mandates. Both the Socialists and the PUPS participated in a coalition government following the election, and Stošić served as a government supporter. He received the forty-second position on the list in the 2014 election and was re-elected when the list again won forty-four mandates. The PUPS was not part of Serbia's coalition government in the parliament that followed, but the party continued to support the government in the assembly. &&&&& &&&&& For the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election, the United Pensioners joined the ''Aleksandar Vučić – Serbia Is Winning'' electoral alliance led by the Serbian Progressive Party. Stošić received the 113th position on this list and was elected to a third term when it won a landslide victory with 131 out of 250 mandates. The PUPS rejoined Serbia's government following the election. &&&&& &&&&& Stošić is currently a member of the assembly's culture and information committee and its European integration committee; a deputy member of the committee on Kosovo-Metohija and the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Croatia, Denmark, France, Italy, Macedonia, Montenegro, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

During this era he formed a country music duo, North Starr, with colleague Mike Northcott, and released his second album, ''From the Inside Out'', on the independent label Asoma Records in 1994. &&&&& &&&&& He has continued to perform occasional live appearances at public events. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In the early 2000s, he and his family moved to Killaloe, where they built an environmentally sustainable off-the-grid home in the Earthship style. &&&&& &&&&& His niece, Tasha Schumann, is a rapper who performs under the stage name Tasha the Amazon. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

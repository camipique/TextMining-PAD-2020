''Kotaku'' reviewed the game, stating that they found it satisfying to fix up homes that are "often extremely gross or ugly" and that "Manifesting your vision of a decent, sellable house onto these garbage heaps feels amazing—especially because it happens on such a granular scale." ''Game Informer'' was more mixed, writing that "Flipping your first few houses is fun, but the game doesn’t have the scope or flexibility to stay interesting for long". ''PC Gamer'' was critical, stating that "There's a definite satisfaction in taking a gross room and making it look nice, and it's pretty cool that you can knock down (and rebuild) walls, but I just don't find the act of slowly and mechanically painting and cleaning much fun, especially with the knowledge that my actual house could do with a bit of that." &&&&& &&&&& === Awards === &&&&& The game was nominated for "Game, Simulation" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ephraim Palace &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Ephraim Palace''' () is a Rococo-style building in Berlin, Germany, originally constructed in 1766. Despite the destruction of the palace in 1936 by Nazi Germany, the beginning of a reconstruction was possible in 1985, as many elements of the facade had been stored in East Germany. Today, the Ephraim Palace is a cultural-heritage property and houses a museum, mostly dealing with cultural topics. &&&&& &&&&& The Ephraim Palace is named after Veitel Heine Ephraim, who hired the experienced architect Friedrich Wilhelm Dieterichs to design a palace on the property of the oldest pharmacy of Berlin. &&&&& &&&&& ==Bibliography== &&&&& * Rolf-Herbert Krüger.

Holdenville City Hall &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Holdenville City Hall''', at 102 Creek St. in Holdenville, Oklahoma, was built in 1910. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.	 &&&&& &&&&& It is a red brick building with prominent stone quoins and other details, and has some architectural pretension, being perhaps Federal-influenced. It was built by contractor Jack Britton for $8,700. It was extended to the rear in 1951 to include a fire department. &&&&& &&&&& Its NRHP nomination describes:It is architectually sic significant because it represents a departure from the typical Victorian Romanesque and Western Commercial styles prevalent in Oklahoma architecture. The attempt to reproduce a more classic style for a public building is the physical evidence of emerging order of a frontier town. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

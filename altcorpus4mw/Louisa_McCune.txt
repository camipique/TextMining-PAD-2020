Her great-grandfather, W.W. Rucks, was the co-founder of Oklahoma City's Wesley Hospital (1910), which went on to become Presbyterian Hospital (1964) and later OU Medical Center. Her grandmother, Louise Earthman Rucks (1904-1989), wrote a column for thirty-six years about animals for ''The Daily Oklahoman'' called “Hound Hill," which is now the namesake for McCune's residence. McCune's paternal great-grandfather, John Starr Allison, was known as the pioneer town physician in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for many decades until his death in 1955. Her paternal grandfather, Edward H. McCune, was an educator, recognized for his published works of poetry. He also coached Pretty Boy Floyd in basketball during his time in Sallisaw, Oklahoma. McCune is of Scottish descent. McCune has three older siblings: Joe McCune, a lawyer; Allison Davis, an entrepreneur; and Evelyn Stival, a homemaker. &&&&& &&&&& McCune is the mother of three sons, with whom she resides: McCune (Mac); Rucks; and Edward. Her eldest son appeared in a Flaming Lips film, ''Christmas on Mars'', as “the baby,” in a dream sequence with a Martian marching band. She was married to Chad Elmore from 2004 to 2015. &&&&& &&&&& From September 1992 to May 1993, McCune lived in West Africa, where she had temporary employment with Evergreen Helicopters on a World Health Organization project to eradicate onchocerciasis.

In his letter of support, Kurt Vonnegut described Lapham's absence from the hall of fame as being akin to Babe Ruth not being in Cooperstown. He was inducted in February 2007. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Individually and Collectively (The 5th Dimension album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Individually and Collectively''''' is the seventh album of original material by American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1972. This album includes both of the group's final top 10 hits on the Billboard Pop Singles chart - "(Last Night) I Didn't Get To Sleep At All," which reached #8, and "If I Could Reach You," which peaked at #10. Both were also hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, and both feature lead vocals by Marilyn McCoo. The album would scale the Top 200 Album Charts as well, eventually landing at the #58 position on 24 June 1972.  &&&&& &&&&& The album's title is reflective of the record containing content in which the group goes from its famous five-part harmonies to lead-feature songs. Billy Davis, Jr. is the lead on nearly half of the album, including on the group's cover of Elton John's Border Song. Ron Townson is also issued a rare lead vocal on Band of Gold. Black Patch, a Laura Nyro composition which ends the album, features each member taking lead on part of a verse, including - for the first time - Lamonte McLemore. The group would perform this final song on Soul Train, along with the 1973 non-album single, Flashback. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& #"Leave a Little Room" (Lead Vocals: Billy Davis, Jr.) &&&&& #(Last Night) I Didn't Get To Sleep At All (Lead Vocals: Marilyn McCoo) &&&&& #All Kinds Of People (Lead Vocals: Florence Larue) &&&&& #Sky & Sea (From The Musical "Joy") &&&&& #Tomorrow Belongs To The Children (Lead Vocals: Billy Davis, Jr.) &&&&& #Turn Around To Me &&&&& #If I Could Reach You (Lead Vocals: Marilyn McCoo) &&&&& #Half Moon (Lead Vocals: Billy Davis, Jr.) &&&&& #Band Of Gold (Lead Vocals: Ron Townson) (NOTE: not the Freda Payne hit of the same name) &&&&& #Border Song (Lead Vocals: Billy Davis, Jr.) &&&&& #Black Patch &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Marilyn McCoo - vocals &&&&& *Florence LaRue - vocals &&&&& *Billy Davis, Jr. - vocals &&&&& *Lamonte McLemore - vocals &&&&& *Ron Townson - vocals &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

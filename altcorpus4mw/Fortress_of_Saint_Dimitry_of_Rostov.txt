Fortress of Saint Dimitry of Rostov &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''The Fortress of Saint Dmitry of Rostov''' () was a fortification structure of the Russian Empire. In the middle of the 18th century it was of great military and strategic importance and also was the most powerful among the southern fortresses of Russia. The city of Rostov-on-Don was named after the fortress. &&&&& &&&&& The fortress was never a direct place of any military operations; at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774, it lost the importance of border fortification. From one of its former vorstadt the city of Rostov-on-Don of Ekaterinoslav Governorate was established by 1811. In 1835 the garrison and military property of the Rostov Fortress were transferred to Anapa. The ramparts and bastions were demolished at the end of the 19th century. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& === Construction === &&&&& A cossack in the Fortress of Saint Dimitry, 1774. &&&&& In the 1740s there arose the need to build a more powerful fortification on the Don for the protection of Temernitskaya Customs, rather than the existing Fortress of Saint Anna. In 1744, Captain Sipyagin reported on the choice of a place for the construction of fortifications near the Rich Well tract. The Senate rejected the first seven projects, but when two other projects (stone and earth fortifications) were approved, the garrison of the fortress of St. Anna was transferred to a new place on 20 December 1760. On 6 April (17 April New Style) 1761, the Empress Elizaveta Petrovna issued the decree which granted fortress the name of Saint Dmitry of Rostov. On 23 September of the same year took place the laying of its foundations.Fortress of Saint Dimitry of Rostov#cite note-4|4 The construction works were carried out under the leadership of military engineer General Alexander Rigelman. &&&&& &&&&& In 1761 Rigelman oredered to build a brick factory at the Kizierinsky Gully for the needs of construction of Saint Dimitry Fortress.

Lucia v. SEC &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Lucia v. SEC''''', 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the status of administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Court held that they are considered inferior Officers of the United States subject to the Appointments Clause, and thus must be appointed through the President or other delegated officer of the United States, rather than hired. As "inferior" officers, their appointments are not subject to the Senate's advice and consent role. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Like many other government agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses administrative law judges (ALJ) to act as a judge in resolving disputes for the agency related to administrative law, those laws that describe how the agency is run. Prior to this case, through November 2017, the SEC had selected ALJ through an in-house hiring process, without seeking consult of the President or officers. Due to this case, as well as the election of President Donald Trump that put more pressure on the use of ALJs within the government, the SEC formally announced on November 20, 2017 it would have ALJ's appointed by its five Commissioners, as to align with the Constitution's Appointments Clause to eliminate the constitutionality question raised by this case. &&&&& &&&&& In 2012, investment adviser Ray Lucia promoted a retirement investment strategy called "Buckets of Money" through several seminars. The SEC believed Lucia was offering misleading information in these presentations, and charged Lucia and his investment company under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. SEC ALJ Cameron Elliot was assigned the case, and after hearings, ruled against Lucia, fining him and barring him for life for participating in the investment industry. Lucia appealed the case to the SEC, arguing that Elliot's position was considered an "officer of the United States" due to being able to pass judgement, and as per the Appointments Clause, must be appointed to that position by the President or other officers with delegated authority to do so; Elliot had not gone through such a process. As such, Lucia argued that Judge Elliot was not empowered to issue the ruling. The SEC rejected Lucia's claim that ALJs were officers of the United States; the ALJs used by SEC may issue decisions with significant ramifications for those charged, but these decisions are reviewed by the SEC Commissioners (who are appointed by the President) before they are approved and implemented. To the SEC, they considered that the ALJs, to fulfill their duties, only needed to be employees of the agency, as was the case with Judge Elliot, and did not need to be appointed, and dismissed Lucia's appeal. &&&&& &&&&& Lucia's argument was not the first time the question of ALJ's status had been raised in courts, but in at least two previous cases within the United States courts of appeals system had ruled that the question was a matter of administrative review, and not a constitutional question. Lucia's case at the SEC led one of the SEC commissioners hearing the case to question whether ALJ must be appointed or not. &&&&& &&&&& Lucia appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also aligned with the SEC in that ALJs did not serve officers of the United States. Upon an ''en banc'' hearing within the Court of Appeals, the full ten-member panel was split, forcing them to issue a ''per curiam'' decision that maintained the SEC's stance. &&&&& &&&&& Supreme Court &&&&& Lucia petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari in July 2017, asking the Court to rule if ALJs are officers of the United States and thus subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court granted to hear the case in January 2018, with oral arguments set for April 23, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& During the case's review in lower courts, the United States government had backed the SEC's stance. With the election of Donald Trump as President, the government's stance had changed, favoring the argument that ALJs should be appointed. The SEC had already changed its process of hiring ALJs prior to the Supreme Court decision, by requiring appointments to be approved by a vote of the Commission. In its brief to the Supreme Court, the government also held the stance that as ALJs should be appointed, they should also be able to be dismissed at the President's or other delegated officer's discretion. The Court did not consider this question during oral hearings and internal debates. &&&&& &&&&& The Court ruled on June 21, 2018, in a 7–2 decision affirming Lucia's statement that ALJs are officers of the United States, since they are being effectively being given judicial power, and thus must be appointed by the President or a delegated officer. The Court ruled that Lucia must now be due a new hearing before a different, properly appointed officer from the SEC, but otherwise did not comment on any other aspect of Lucia's case. The majority opinion was written by Justice Elena Kagan and joined by Justices John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch. Justice Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Gorsuch. While this decision is expected to allow any entity with a pending case before an SEC ALJ to request a new ruling, the ruling was crafted as to prevent completed cases from being reopened, or if this would apply to cases open at other agencies besides the SEC. &&&&& &&&&& Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in part with the judgment and dissented in part, with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joining in his dissent. Breyer agreed that the appointment of ALJs by SEC staff rather than by the Commissioners themselves was not lawful. However, this unlawfulness arose from a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Because this violation was statutory in nature, it was unnecessary to address the constitutional question. In addition, Breyer argued that it was problematic to determine the "inferior Officer" status of ALJs without first deciding the "pre-existing ''Free Enterprise Fund'' question— namely, what effect that holding would have on the statutory 'for cause' removal protections that Congress provided for administrative law judges." Finally, Breyer disagreed with the need for a hearing before a different ALJ, as it is not clear that the Constitution requires a hearing before a different "Officer" after an Appointments Clause violation. &&&&& &&&&& Sotomayor also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Ginsburg, stating that ALJs should not be treated as officers as their judgments are not treated as final and binding. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

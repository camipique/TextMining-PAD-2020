Horison &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Horison''''' is a monthly literary magazine in Indonesia. &&&&& &&&&& It was founded in 1966 and originally run by the Indonesian Foundation (Yayasan Indonesia). The first issue of Horison was published on July, 1966. &&&&& &&&&& The idea to create such a magazine belonged to the writer and publicist Mochtar Lubis. The first editorial board consisted of Mochtar Lubis, HB Jassin, Zaini, Taufik Ismail, Arief Budiman (Su Haw Hin), D.S. Muliano. . &&&&& &&&&& The magazine advocates the freedom of creativity of writers, the diversity of literary forms and genres, encourages the development of young talents. &&&&& &&&&& Such well-known Indonesian writers and poets as Umar Kayam, Danarto, Arswendo Atmovilito, Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, Darmanto, Abdul Hadi WM and others expressed themselves for the first time in this magazine. &&&&& &&&&& Initially, the magazine was dominated by works with a clear political background, since the mid-1970s - mainly by the avant-garde works (Sutardji Kalzum Bahri, Putu Wijaya, Ikranegara, Danarto). &&&&& &&&&& In the years 1966-1975, it was the only established literary magazine in the country. The publication in it was a recognition of the literary talent of a writer or a poet. In the 1980s many prominent writers moved away from the magazine, although its publication continues thanks to the efforts of Taufiq Ismail and the writers of his circle. &&&&& &&&&& Since 1996, the magazine has an appendix "Kakilangit" (Horizon) destined for students and teachers of literature. &&&&& &&&&& Since July 2016, the transfer from paper to electronic format edition has been started. There are four sections in it: poetry, short story, essays, criticism . &&&&& &&&&& Together with the Indonesian Wikipedia, the work has begun to digitize the magazine paper version archive . &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/945/Horison &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

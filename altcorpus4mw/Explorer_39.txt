228	Explorer_39
Explorer 39 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Explorer 39''', also known as '''AD-C''' (Air Density C), was an American scientific satellite belonging to series '''Air Density'''. It was launched on August 8, 1968, join with Explorer 40, from Launch Complex 5 of the Vandenberg Air Force Base, through a Scout rocket. Explorer 39 orbited the Earth once every 118.2 minutes, at an inclination of 80.6Â°. Its perigee was and apogee was . &&&&& &&&&& Explorer 39 was an inflatable sphere, 3.6 m in diameter. It was orbited to make atmospheric density determinations. The satellite was successfully launched into a nearly polar, highly elliptical orbit. It was folded and carried into orbit, together with ejection and inflation equipment, as part of the payload of Explorer 40. Two density experiments were performed. &&&&& &&&&& One involved the study of systematic density variation, and the other was concerned with nonsystematic density changes. The upper atmospheric densities were derived from sequential observations of the sphere by use of an attached 136.62 MHz radio tracking beacon and by optical tracking. The radio beacon ceased transmitting in June 1971. Since that time it has been necessary to rely solely on the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network for tracking. &&&&& &&&&& Explorer 39 re-entered the atmosphere on June 22, 1981. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Explorer 19 &&&&& * Explorer 24 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Explorer Series Satellites.

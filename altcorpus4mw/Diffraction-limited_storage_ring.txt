Diffraction-limited storage ring &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Diffraction-limited storage rings''' (DLSR), or '''ultra-low emittance storage rings''', are synchrotron light sources where the emittance of the electron-beam in the storage ring is smaller or comparable to the emittance of the x-ray photon beam they produce at the end of their insertion devices. &&&&& These facilities operate in the soft to hard x-ray range (100eV—100keV) with extremely high brilliance (in the order of 1021—1022 photons/s/m2/mrad2/0.1%BW) &&&&& &&&&& Together with x-ray Free-electron laser, they constitute the fourth generation of light sources, characterized by a relatively high coherent flux (in the order of 1014—1015photons/s/0.1%BW for DLSR) and enable extended physical and chemical characterizations at the nano-scale. &&&&& &&&&& Existing diffraction-limited storage rings &&&&& &&&&& *MAX IV Laboratory, in Lund, Sweden. &&&&& &&&&& DLSR upgrade or facilities under construction &&&&& &&&&& *Sirius, in Campinas, Brazil &&&&& *Advanced Photon Source Upgrade ( APS-U), in Argonne, Illinois, USA &&&&& &&&&& Planned or projected DLSR upgrades or new facilities &&&&& &&&&& *European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Extremely Brilliant Source ( ESRF-EBS), in Grenoble, France, starting December 10, 2018 &&&&& *Advanced Light Source, Upgrade ( ALS-U), in Berkeley, California, USA &&&&& *Swiss Light Source 2, Upgrade (SLS-2), in Viligen, Switzerland &&&&& *Diamond II, Upgrade ( Diamond II), in Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK &&&&& *ELETTRA 2.0, Upgrade ( Elettra 2.0), in Trieste, Italy &&&&& *High Energy Photon Source, (HEPS), in Beijing, China &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *X-Ray Free Electron Lasers &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

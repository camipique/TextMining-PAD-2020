It is located in Rannoch Moor in the Council Area of Perth and Kinross.

The main inflow to the loch in the east is the Garbh Ghaoir. Loch Eigheach is traversed by the River Gaur that flows out of Loch Eigheach in the west. The water leaving Loch Eigheach across the River Gaur first flows through a hydroelectric power station before being returned to the riverbed. &&&&& &&&&& The shores of Loch Eigheach are completely uninhabited. Parts of the north shore and the dam wall are accessed by the B846. All other shorelines are not accessible by car. Loch Eigheach is a fishing area where mainly perch are caught. &&&&& &&&&& Loch Eigheach from the north &&&&& &&&&& External Links &&&&& * The wild Fisher &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

The film is not a social commentary on the drug menace of Punjab but more like one person's story, by which he hopes to inspire others to kick the habit." Arora praised the movie for sticking to the story's "tight curves" as well as the performances of the lead actors. However he criticized some fight scenes and the music in the film. Arora also noted, "Given that it is apparently the first Punjabi film based on an autobiography, it is not a bad start for the regional film industry." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

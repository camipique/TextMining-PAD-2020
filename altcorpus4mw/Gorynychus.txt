130	Gorynychus
Gorynychus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Gorynychus''''' is a genus of therapsid from the mid-Permian from Kotelnich, Russia. The genus is monospecific, containing the single species ''G. masyutinae''. It was named after the three-headed dragon Zmey Gorynych (Змей Горыныч) from Russian mythology. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The species, only known from its holotype, was wolf-sized and appears to have represented the largest predator in the Kotelnich fauna. Like many theriodonts, it had strongly developed and prominent canine teeth. &&&&& &&&&& Paleoecology &&&&& The discovery of such a large therocephalian as the apex predator of its environment coupled with the discovery of a smaller gorgonopsid, the smaller and nocturnal ''Nochnitsa'', in the same formation indicates that a faunal turnover was occurring at the time, with therocephalians taking over the gorgonopsians' role as the dominant predators in their environment. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

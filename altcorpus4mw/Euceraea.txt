80	Euceraea
Euceraea &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Euceraea''''' is a genus of three species of shrubs and small trees in the willow family Salicaceae native to the Guiana Shield of northeastern South America. Previously it was treated in the family Flacourtiaceae but was moved along with its close relatives to the Salicaceae based on analyses of DNA data. ''Euceraea'' is closely related to the genera ''Casearia'' and ''Neoptychocarpus'', but differs in its inflorescences of composite spikes. One species, ''Euceraea rheophytica'', is a rheophyte. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

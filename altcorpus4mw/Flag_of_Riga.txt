After Riga joining the Hanseatic League in 1282 sources mention that the flag of Riga ships has a white cross, but the shape and color of the flag are not indicated (in the beginning of the 14th century it was known that Riga had a black flag with a white cross). After 1582, the flag of Riga was white with a red coat of arms of the city, while in the middle 17th century, thanks to the city's heroism defending against Grand Duchy of Moscow troops, the king of Sweden assigned his royal colors to Riga: a blue flag with a yellow cross, with in the center of the cross two keys were crossed on the red shield. The flag was used until 1860. &&&&& &&&&& The blue-white flag of Riga, which was used today, was created in 1673, when it was approved in the statutes of Riga - blue and white bands in rectangular shape, with the coat of arms of Riga in the center. The flag was used alongside with the flag given by the Swedish king. &&&&& &&&&& From the 1900s until 1917, a new tricolor flag with equal blue, red and white bands was approved for Riga. &&&&& &&&&& During the 1920s the blue-white flag of Riga was restored, and officially approved on 4 May 1937until 1940. &&&&& &&&&& During the era of Soviet Latvia, Riga adopted a new flag, with different obverse and reverse side of the flag. The obverse side of the flag consisted of Lenin's portrait with a laurel branch and the inscription "Workers of the world, unite!" in Latvian. The reverse side of the flag consisted of the coat of arms of the Latvian SSR, and the inscription "Riga City" in both Latvian and Russian. &&&&& &&&&& Current flag &&&&& The current flag, the blue-white flag was restored in 1995. The flag consisted of a horizontal bicolour of blue and white, with the coat of arms of Riga in the middle. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& Hanse Riga.svg|Flag of Riga after it joins the Hanseatic League (1282) &&&&& Flag of Riga (mid 17th century - 1860s).gif|Flag of Riga given by the Swedish King &&&&& Riga.

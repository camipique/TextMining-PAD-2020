206	Lamprophyllite
Lamprophyllite &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lamprophyllite''' (named for its lustrous cleavage) is a rare, but widespread mineral Ti-silicate mineral usually found in intrusive agpasitic igneous rocks. Yellow, reddish brow, Vitreous, Pearly. &&&&& &&&&& Lamprophyllite formula is (Sr,Ba,K,Na)2Na(Na,Fe,Mn)2TiTi2O2(Si2O7)2(O, OH,F)2 . Full isomorphic range between lampropyllite and baritollalpropyllite exist. &&&&& &&&&& The general crystal-chemical formula for lampropyllite-related minerals can be written as A2(M1)(M2)2(M3)X2 5 L2(Si2O7)2O2, where the contents of the O and H sheets are given in square brackets in this order and A = Sr, Ba,K, Na; M1 = Na, Mn2+; M2 = Na, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ca; M3 = Ti, Mn2+, Mg, Fe3+, Fe2+; L = Ti, Fe3+; X = OH, O, F. &&&&& &&&&& Lamprophyllite is monoclinic, The mineral also has an orthorhombic polytype Unit-cell parameters mainly depend from the cationic composition in the interlayer position A The crystal structures of the lamprophyllite-related minerals are based upon HOH modules consisting of a central octahedral O sheet sandwiched between two heteropolyhedral H sheets. &&&&& &&&&& Lamprophyllite melts incongruently (880 °C) with formation of titanium oxides: rutile, tausonite, freudenbergite. Syntetic lamprophyllite synthesis was crystallized from melt. Tewly formed lamprophyllite show higher Sr/Ba ratioi than in equilibrium melt. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

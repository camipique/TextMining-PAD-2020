8000	FIM–IRTA_war
FIM–IRTA war &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''FIM–IRTA war''' was a political conflict contested throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s by the two representative organizations in Grand Prix motorcycle racing, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) and the International Road-Racing Teams Association (IRTA), as well as then-Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone. The battle started in 1990 when the FIM gave the IRTA and Bernie Ecclestone more governing power (such as appointing new grand prix races) and came to a head in 1992 when the FIA cancelled the contract that would have allowed the IRTA and ROPA, the circuit owners, the right to market the television rights and instead giving those rights to Dorna Sports. &&&&& &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The conflict started when in 1986, after various problems with the then existing Grand Prix Riders Association (GPRA), the International Road-Racing Teams Association (IRTA) was founded by Mike Trimby, morphing from a riders' trade union to a body representing the various teams. The IRTA was founded to resolve various track safety problems (such as a factory team strike at the 1982 French motorcycle Grand Prix in Nogaro due to dangerous track conditions), as well as financial problems that plagued the sport during the 1980s. This however, was a start of a period of huge change for Grand Prix motorcycle racing, as this would kick off a power struggle between the FIM, the IRTA, Bernie Ecclestone and various other companies. &&&&& &&&&& 1986–1990: The calm before the storm &&&&& After the foundation of the IRTA, the power struggle between the FIM and IRTA had started. This battle would be paired with various other, minor struggles with for example the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) and regional contract holders. &&&&& &&&&& In 1990, the IRTA management council met for the first time under Jos Vaessen's presidency on 13 and 14 January 1990. He announced that ''"the party was over"'' and that it was necessary to set to work. After the election of Vaessen, he had several meetings with FIM leaders, among others the secretary general, which were considered close to Luigi Brenni and were favourable to a negotiated solution with the IRTA with whom relations had been poor. This discussion between Jos Vaessen and the secretary general Guy Maitre enabled the two men to iron out any differences and to find a common ground for close collaboration. However, the FIM was far from high ground. &&&&& &&&&& A MotoMedia meeting had been held on 11 January 1990. The following points had been discussed: an agreement between the IRTA and ROPA, passed on by the FIM, would introduce one single time-keeping system by transponder for the 1990 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. &&&&& &&&&& Another issue arose: the fall of the Berlin Wall had led the two German federations to ask the FIM if they could organise national events with riders holding national licences from both countries. &&&&& &&&&& The Geneva meetings were held from 1 to 5 March 1990. The council was complete with Jos Vaessen (president), Francesco Zerbi (deputy president), Neville Goss MBE (interim treasurer), Guy Maitre (Secretary general), Tore Kittilsen, Jan Krivka, Oriol Mauri Aurell, Wilhelm Noll, Andrzej Witkowski and ed Youngblood (vice presidents), Joseph Zegwaard (CCR president), Tage Magnusson (CMS), Eric Schmidt (CTE), Günter Sorber (CCP), Orio Puig Bulto (CT), Pietro Rozza (CTC), Arendt Van der Leest (BF), Giancarlo Pasini (CP) and Gordon Hadfield (CM). Also present were Nicolas Schmit and Luis Soriano Rodriguez. &&&&& &&&&& A violent polemic had taken place in Australia following the decision not to accept the Australian Grand Prix at Eastern Creek. It had forced president Vaessen to spend a few hours on the other side of the world to explain the FIM's position to the ACCA and to support its president L.J. Thomson who was in a minority and put under pressure by the government of New South Wales (Sydney). The ACCA request was confirmed to hold the Australian Grand Prix on 16 September 1990 at Phillip Island. &&&&& &&&&& A dispute with the FISA was provoked by its decision to refuse any motor sport event 30 days before an F1 Grand Prix. The FIM protested to the FISA and talks had to be held with Mr Balestre. &&&&& &&&&& The revised appendix concerning doping and their use was accepted. The legal status of the CM doctors was discussed. In some cases, the medical opinion of inspector doctors from the CM was required. Doctors were not authorised to work in some countries except by the law of the Good Samaritan. The view of the CJ or the FIM lawyer was requested. Dr Costa’s position was also discussed. He was the official doctor of the Italian federation and looked after Italian riders. He and his mobile clinic was essentially funded by the FMI, but also sponsored by other companies including the IRTA. When he looked after an injured rider, he forwarded the case to the head doctor of the event in question and submitted a list of injured riders he had seen. &&&&& &&&&& The president gave a report on his presence at the Hungaroring circuit on 30 April 1990 and the conflict he had witnessed. The company Flammini Racing, holders of the TV and marketing rights for the Superbike World Championship was on one side and a Hungarian company (IPV), the race organisers who had signed a contract with the German company (Moto Motion) were on the other. The Hungarian federation stated it was not aware of the latter agreement. President Vaessen had to personally go to the track to have the Flammini Racing signage put in place. Similar types of problems had arisen in Hockenheim. The president considered this situation to be unacceptable and proposed to call – again – another meeting with the FMNRs. He also expressed a wish that a vice president should go to each remaining event on the 1990 calendar to protect the interests of the contract between the FIM and Flammini Racing. &&&&& &&&&& Relations with the FISA were not improving. After repeated requests for a meeting with president Balestre, the FISA had finally suggested a day that had subsequently been cancelled. &&&&& &&&&& An FIM (CCR/CT) meeting was held with representatives from the industry on 23 June 1990 in Assen. Afterwards, Mrs Zegwaard and Puig Bulto went to Japan to meet the managers from Honda and Yamaha and those of Suzuki in Le Mans at the 1990 French motorcycle Grand Prix. The report was drawn up by Joseph Zegwaard and its aim was to request the collaboration of the manufacturers to increase the number of starters in the 500cc and to put an end to a series of accidents which happened particularly, but not only in the 500cc class, probably due to the current racing engine characteristics. Curiously, the first question from Honda concerned the decision to introduce an "executive committee" to direct road racing Grand Prixs. The second concerned the so-called manufacturer’s technical commission created by the IRTA. The Honda management present, Messrs Aika, Ikenoya, Matsuda, Oguma and Tsunnoda clearly stated that they preferred to deal directly with the FIM and not through any third party, i.e. their clients. They stated their concern at new attempts by the IRTA to (re)take control of the GPs. However, opinions seemed to differ among those present around the table concerning the solutions to be adopted on a technical – and financial – level. The idea of a 3-cylinder 375cc was still on the table but the fact that the FIM preferred an exclusive 500cc class ''"seemed to make any solution impossible"''. HRC seemed worried about the increase in costs. On the subject of availability of machines for the 1991 season, the response was surprising: ''"it is not possible to produce a set of 4 cylinder machines for sale, since HRC is too busy and there are no budgets for it. It would be possible to produce between 30 and 35 3-cylinder machines for around 52,000 US Dollars as long as orders were received by mid-August"''. &&&&& &&&&& The next day, Messrs Zegwaard and Puig Bulto were at Yamaha with Messrs Kuroda, Maekawa, Nomura, Okano and Sasaki. Like at Honda, the managers clearly stated that they wished to co-operate with the FIM but more directly and officially. Their standpoint concerning IRTA's initiative to introduce a constructors' technical commission ''"was, to our surprise, even stronger than that expressed by Honda"''. They were not opposed to a possible solution to improve the handling of the 500cc by imposing a crankshaft inertia effect. They did not even mention (contrary to the people from HRC) the difficulty of doing this. They had also thought of using engine restrictors. In terms of availability, they were planning to construct around 15 to 20 500 4 cylinder machines according to the 1990 specifications adapted to the regulations of a minimum of 130 kg, but only available on a rental basis. For the 1992 season, they were thinking of constructing a batch of engines for sale. &&&&& &&&&& The following day a joint meeting at the MFJ headquarters was held with Messrs Aika, Ikenoya and Maekawa. The question of an increased minimum weight was considered a given, but insufficient. Among other possibilities, the reduction of compression rates, the limitation of the engine speed, the inertia factor (Dg2) and the level of octane in the fuel were considered the only effective ones. A meeting was planned with Mr Itoh (Suzuki) who would soon return to Japan. The racing departments of the three makes met and communicated their solution to the FIM. Other suggestions were made during the dinner: limiting the 125 and 250 classes to "non-factory" machines, the possible limitation of these classes to a maximum of two factory riders per constructor, an increase in weight for the 500cc twin cylinders and a limitation of the 500 class to twin cylinder machines. This would make machines more competitive and reliable which would mean progress in terms of costs and performance, and a possibility to construct a minimum number for sale. Finally a manufacturer's technical commission formed of delegates from motorcycle constructors with direct representation at the CT was raised. &&&&& &&&&& The extraordinary meeting of the management council held on 8 and 9 September 1990 was very tense. Draconian measures had been taken in Assen by president Vaessen: the introduction of the GP executive committee with immediate application, following serious incidents which had occurred in Rijeka during the 250cc 1990 Yugoslav motorcycle Grand Prix (they had plunged road racing and the FIM into a difficult situation with the German rider Reinhold Roth handicapped for life). This immediate reaction from the president was in general well received in the world of GPs, but it was unfortunately not to last. &&&&& &&&&& The president explained that following the decision not to extend the MotoMedia contract beyond 1992, he had had numerous meetings with interested companies, including seven who had made offers. There was also an interest in the right to acquire a commercial title. This right belonged to the FIM and the council agreed for it to be negotiated from 1991 onwards. The same council gave its approval for TV rights to be negotiated for the 1993-1997 period for a total sum which should not be less than 18 million U.S. Dollars. At the request of Mr Noll, sufficient bank guarantees would be demanded and the solvency of the partners guaranteed. Since the dollar at the time was weak, it was recommended to fix the sums in Swiss francs or to fix minimum dollar exchange rates. The council also gave its approval to extending the Flammini Racing contract for the years 1993 – 1995. Negotiations were also underway for track racing. &&&&& &&&&& The executive board met on 6 October 1990 in Monza to examine the end of the 1990 season. FIM homologation was insufficient because it did not take into account the various aspects related to organising a Grand Prix. Some tracks could not be used in 1991 because of problems encountered this year, such as the Belgian, Swedish and Hungarian rounds. The situation of machines available was very uncertain because Japanese manufacturers had ''"diametrically opposed"'' interests. In motocross, the future of the 500cc class was at stake. &&&&& &&&&& On the subject of TV contracts, president Vaessen announced that he had sent a letter to the seven companies who had made offers giving them ten days to make a second offer above 20 million U.S. Dollars. A confidentiality contract binding president Vaessen was proposed to the company or specialised agency appointed to manage the rights. &&&&& &&&&& Concerning the problems of 500cc machines for the 1991 season, Yamaha had committed to provide ten machines and Suzuki four. But Honda was apparently unhappy with the FIM decision to fix the minimum weight at 130 kg and had not yet confirmed its intention to construct ten additional machines. The ROPA and IRTA had already accepted to act as guarantors along with the FIM to Honda for the sale of these machines to sponsors. &&&&& &&&&& Finally, the executive board discussed the procedure of electing vice presidents in order to have the desired situation of maximum ten vice presidents including six continents up to a maximum of five per continent when all continents were represented. The congress took place from 21 to 27 October 1990 at the Budapest congress centre. 49 federations were represented (a maximum was achieved on Tuesday) including seven by proxy. The council reviewed current issues. The meeting with IRTA took place with discussions focusing on technical aspects and fuel, in particular unleaded fuel, planned for the 1991 season was strongly contested by the teams even though the proposal had come from the Japanese manufacturers themselves. &&&&& &&&&& Concerning the contract for GPs, the president believed that in spite of the fact that the council had given him free rein during the previous session, developments in this matter were so important that the council should itself appoint the company to be selected from the six still remaining having made offers for a five-year contract (1993-1997). The council declared itself opposed to signing a contract with Bernie Ecclestone who already held the F1 rights. It wanted a company that could ''"develop our sport in an independent way"''. A first proposal was therefore eliminated. Of the five remaining, the highest (30 million U.S. Dollars) had been made by the Spanish company ''"Promocion del Deporte"'' linked to the Dorna Group which it was itself controlled by the banking concern Banesto. Among other things this group already held the TV rights for the famous club Real Madrid and was prepared to supply a bank guarantee amounting to 10% of the total. &&&&& &&&&& President Vaessen responded to the various remarks and pointed out that each company who had made an initial offer had received a letter giving it an additional deadline to submit a new bid if necessary. The responses received within the deadline had been sealed in the event of any protest. No offer had surpassed USD 30 million. This was why the management council had come out in favour of pursuing negotiations with ''"Promocion del Deporte"''. The president asked the general assembly to decide, in a secret ballot for the president and management council, for or against continuing negotiations with ''"Promocion del Deporte"''. The result was 66 votes for, 17 against and 7 abstentions. &&&&& &&&&& Two requests for membership were presented from the federations of Nicaragua and Macau. The Czechoslovakian federation was changing name following political changes since 1989: the UAMK had become the CSMF. As for Germany, the two federations the OMK and the ADMV, had agreed only to vote as a single federation from 23 October onwards. The ban on South African riders to participate in FIM Championships and Prizes was lifted from 1991 onwards. &&&&& &&&&& The council refused for the GPs of Belgium and Hungary to be retained on the calendar in view of the serious organisational problems encountered that year. The Malaysian Grand Prix therefore made its first appearance as well as that of San Marino in Misano. All the circuits requiring work had to be ready by 31 December 1990. Finally Mr Adrian Veys withdrew from the commission. He was replaced as CCR vice president by the former side-car champion Max Deubel and as Belgian delegate by a certain Claude Danis. &&&&& &&&&& At the CMS, the future of the 500cc class was discussed but also the side-cars. The proposal to race the 500cc with the 250cc had been made in Amsterdam on 7 October and as expected, some manufacturers were in favour and others were against. A compromise was soon reached: to allow four stroke machines in this class and leave the two strokes to progressively fizzle out. &&&&& &&&&& 1991: The climax &&&&& A management council meeting was held on 19 and 20 January 1991 at the Hotel Penta in Geneva. The Gulf War had just begun and Mr Youngblood had remained in the United States due to air traffic problems. The situation of the 500cc GP class was preoccupying everyone. During the MotoMedia meeting, it had been proposed to include 750cc TTF-1 machines (four strokes). Since then, all those concerned had given their opinion which was largely negative. The difference in performance and the confusion with the superbike championship would not provide a valid solution. &&&&& &&&&& The draft contract with Dorna Promocion del Deporte was widely discussed. The company was offering a guarantee of 2 million dollars - more than a million payable on 30 June 1991 to be deducted from the first payment in three parts and added to the guarantee. Mr Zerbi stated that this company was very well structured and gave clear responses to questions. The ROPA letter claiming a share of 50% of the income from this contract was not considered acceptable and it was repeated that ''"in the event of income being distributed, it would be paid to the FMNRs"''. The contract would be signed during February 1991. &&&&& &&&&& The contract with Dorna Promocion del Deporte had been signed on 26 February in Madrid. ROPA, IRTA and AICP had been consulted prior to signature. Leaving aside the sale of the title rights which belonged to the FIM and the fact that the Spanish company was not specialised in motor sport, ''"they seemed satisfied"''. The appointment of a press officer was commented on by the secretary general who underlined the strong points ''"in particular a perfect knowledge of motorcycle sport"''. He would take up his functions in August 1991. &&&&& &&&&& The president reported on his first meeting with Jean-Marie Balestre (FIA president) which was according to him ''"fruitful"''. Several issues had been discussed such as track homologation, electrical vehicles and pirate events. The problem of the FISA regulation banning motor sport events on a track 30 days before an F1 GP had been discussed. Mr Balestre would propose at the FISA plenary conference that only world championship events should be banned in this timeframe – which of course did not settle very much: the place occupied by the car could not be compared with that of the motorcycle in the world as Mr Balestre did not hesitate to point out. Mr Goss remarked – we were once again back at the management council – that concerning road safety, collaboration between the FIA and FIM were excellent. &&&&& &&&&& For the minimum weight, to simplify the procedure, the weight would be controlled after removing the fuel tank. Following the meeting with IRTA, it seemed that the introduction of unleaded fuel in 1992 would cause problems in terms of control. It emerged that a control before the start was impossible and it was suggested to take samples after the race. On the subject of the 500cc class, Mr Butler asked that the proposed changes be submitted to the constructors to whom ''"we should offer the last opportunity to decide themselves on the future of this class"''. He added that Yamaha intended to sell a few engines and to work with European manufacturers on the cycle parts. Given the current economic situation, it seemed unlikely that the constructors would have the possibility to invest in totally new projects. IRTA also asked the CT for precise directives on the subject of scrutineering. The same procedure should be followed at each GP. According to the CCR president, it was necessary for it to be the same delegate like in the Superbikes, who should operate at each event. Bikes with rotating engines would be accepted in 500cc GPs with the points obtained awarded to the rider but not to the constructor. &&&&& &&&&& The next management council meeting was held on 22 and 23 June. In the meantime, things had got considerably worse. Firstly from the very first GP in Suzuka, the GP jury meetings had not worked well. The atmosphere had degenerated at the Spanish GP in Jerez, where representatives from Dorna Promocion del Deporte were to make a presentation to the teams, the riders and the press which had not convinced everybody. Then the situation in Yugoslavia had forced the FIM to take a decision during the German GP – the teams were not really in agreement to go there. The circuit of Jarama was chosen instead. At Interlagos, the situation was getting worse. Kevin Schwantz had gone to São Paulo with Mike Trimby and had ridden round the track. He signalled his disapproval concerning the work completed in particular at a place where safety was in his opinion, compromised. He left straight away without giving any interviews. &&&&& &&&&& Environmental issues began to arise; Mr Youngblood noted that noise controls and road safety were related to this issue. It was important for the FIM to have a policy on this matter and the public should know that the international federation was worried about the environment. &&&&& &&&&& At the following GP in Assen, criticisms poured in from every direction. The executive board meeting was swiftly approaching on 11 August 1991. And what would be the subject for discussion at this executive board? Of the Brazilian GP at Interlagos of course, or rather, of its ''"withdrawal from the calendar and replacement"''. Those present were Messrs Vaessen, Zerbi, Kittilsen, Maitre, Witkowski and Youngblood (executive board). Also present were Messrs Joseph Zegwaard, president of the CCR, Tage Magnusson, president of the CMS (there was also a problem with 500 motocross) and Alfredo Romulo Tambucci, president of the CBM (Brazilian federation). The Brazilian GP provoked much discussion. The riders and IRTA were refusing to go to São Paulo and this forced the FIM and the CBM to find an alternative. The CBM withdrew from the organisation. Since the FIM wished to retain the number of 15 GPs in the season, the proposal from the French federation was accepted to organise the GP at the track of Le Mans on the scheduled date (8 September). This would be the ''"Le Mans Road Racing GP"'' or as some called it, ''"the Brazilian GP in Le Mans"''. &&&&& &&&&& Rumours of a parallel championship were becoming more and more widespread. The press was calling it – again – a ''"World Series"''. At the same time, criticism continued to grow. In a few months, the situation had deteriorated to a point of no return. Finally president Vaessen had to make a press statement at the 1991 Italian GP in Mugello. This declaration was followed by an improvised press conference from which by common agreement he emerged positively. But this time dialogue with IRTA appeared to be over as it had already begun talks with Bernie Ecclestone. &&&&& &&&&& After a not really productive meeting in Le Mans between the representatives from the FIM, Dorna and the sponsors, the council meeting of 21 and 22 September 1991 would get more to the root of the problem. The representatives from Dorna were introduced. Messrs Richard Golding and Carmelo Ezpeleta presented the company Dorna to the members of the council. On 13 September Mr Golding had sent a letter to president Vaessen in which he asserted clearly that the situation was extremely delicate for there was a real possibility that a parallel series might be created. In order to react effectively, Dorna needed all its weapons to be able to show that it could offer arguments just as strong as those of IRTA/Ecclestone. To fight Ecclestone on common ground, it had to have the same rights as he, i.e. marketing and TV rights. In order to allow Dorna to react, the president authorised the Spanish company to undertake commercial negotiations, the contents of which had to be submitted to the management council. Mr Golding indicated that he had met Mr Ecclestone twice and that after difficult discussions, an agreement seemed to be in view. For at the end of the day, the FIM had appointed Dorna. It was necessary to protect the FMNs by acting carefully and finding a solution which retained the GPs under the federation’s authority. For this was really at stake. The agreement between IRTA and Ecclestone would withdraw the GPs from the FIM domain. IRTA had even changed its statutes during the last session in Brno and the status of associate FIM member was no longer compatible with its aims. Other problems were emerging. The Australian federation had made contact with Mr Ecclestone concerning the ''"World Series"''. The FIM decided to maintain the bank guarantee of a million dollars. &&&&& &&&&& The following week, President Vaessen went to Barcelona where the F1 GP was taking place to discuss with Messrs Golding and Ecclestone. After a long discussion an agreement was reached, upon reserve, of course, that the management council would accept this solution. It would no longer be a question of a ''"World Series"''. Everyone (the FIM, TWP, Dorna and IRTA) would work together in the same direction with the tasks divided among the interested parties. Two Wheel Promotions and Dorna committed to not creating or encouraging two wheel racing outside the authority of the FIM during this agreement which was initially set at ten years. Of course, Two Wheel Promotions also asked that the contract between the FIM and Dorna concerning the GPs should not conflict with the agreement TWP/IRTA. The FIM had thirty days to obtain all the guarantees and necessary agreements to commit the federation to this deal. &&&&& &&&&& On Tuesday morning, 22 October 1991, the atmosphere was tense. A copy of the agreement reached in Barcelona had been sent to all management council members. A document containing all the details of the agreement following a final meeting between president Vaessen and Bernie Ecclestone and Golding in London, just before he left for New Zealand was also circulated. In the face of opposition from the management council on this agreement, the president remarked that he had not committed the FIM legally, since he alone had signed it (to be valid an FIM contract had also to be signed by the secretary general). In these conditions, he proposed that the council should recommend the general assembly – which was beginning in a few minutes time on Tuesday morning – not to accept this agreement and to accept a different proposal in its place (in part already proposed in the declaration made in Mugello). &&&&& &&&&& Mr Golding informed the president by telephone of the signature of a contract between Dorna and Two Wheel Promotions. Once again the president deplored the fact that the management council members had divulged confidential information. &&&&& &&&&& During the session on 26 October, the president, in the name of the management council, launched an appeal for unity among the national federations in order that resolutions adopted for GPs should be respected. He particularly requested federations to convince their tracks and their riders to remain in the FIM jurisdiction. The following resolution was adopted by the general assembly unanimously with one abstention: ''"A circuit for road racing which is used for an event not organised under the auspices of the FIM will no longer be designated for any international and/or national event under the FIM or the FMN authority"''. &&&&& &&&&& Hardly a week had passed and Mr Vaessen had come back from holiday to find himself faced with delegates and representatives from national federations urging him to ''"find an agreement to recover the GPs"'' (or at least what could be done). The result was a meeting in London on 15 November 1991. This time, president Jos Vaessen was not alone. He had insisted that Deputy president Francesco Zerbi and the CCR president Joseph Zegwaard, should accompany him as well as the secretary general Guy Maitre. Opposite of them were Richard Golding, Dorna executive director, and Bernie Ecclestone, executive director of Two Wheel Promotions (TWP). This time the situation had changed and the agreement was no longer the same as in Barcelona and Heathrow airport: &&&&& * Calendar: the country, circuit and date for each race would be proposed by TWP. The calendar had to be ratified by the FIM. &&&&& * The calendar would be made up of 14 GPs in 14 different countries and one additional GP for a federation that had no circuit. A change could only be made with the unanimous approval of the permanent board or a case of act of god, or cancellation by a promoter. &&&&& * Side-cars would remain a GP class with at least eight races.  &&&&& * Riders: the maximum number of riders per GP would be 30 for each individual class and 20 for side-cars (no grading list). For the side-cars, arrangements would be taken with the permanent board. &&&&& * Regulations: the regulations in force were the Series Regulations as defined in the agreement of 1 October between TWP, IRTA and the teams. &&&&& * Proposals for change could be made by Dorna or TWP; but in each case the FIM had the power of veto (sic). Changes to safety norms, the medical code or the disciplinary code would be made by the FIM upon request (sic). &&&&& * Circuits: homologation inspections were the responsibility of the FIM. Inspections would be conducted with a FISA inspector or another person nominated by the permanent board. Any problem arising from an inspection would be referred to the permanent board for a decision. The final homologation and the circuit licence were the responsibility of the FIM. Safety aspects before and during a GP were in the hands of the safety official nominated by the FIM in agreement with the permanent board. &&&&& * The permanent board would be made up of the FIM president, a representative from Dorna and a representative from TWP. The FIM was obliged to send a representative to each GP. The head steward would be appointed by the FIM and would be the supreme authority, so must be present at each GP. The safety official and starter would be nominated by the FIM in agreement with the permanent board and had to be present at each GP. The FMNRs would appoint the race director. &&&&& * Dorna/TWP were responsible for the pass system. &&&&& * Riders would be paid through Dorna/TWP. &&&&& * The FIM would end the contract with MotoMedia before 31 December 1991. &&&&& * The contract between the FIM and Dorna, signed on 26 February 1991, was cancelled with immediate effect, with neither party obliged to each other in any way whatsoever. In consideration of what remained in place, Dorna would pay the FIM the following sums: 4 million dollars in 1992, 1993 and 1994, 5 million in 1996 and 1997 and 6 million from 1997 to 2001, if the agreements were still valid and a formal agreement had been signed within six months of the date of 15 November 1991. &&&&& * Decisions taken by the permanent board would only be done so unanimously. &&&&& &&&&& The executive board met on 1 December. Those present were: Messrs Vaessen, Zerbi, Kittilsen, Maitre, Witkowski, Youngblood and Zegwaard. Faces were not particularly happy. The president indicated that there had been a lot of criticism and confusion following the decision of the general assembly. Federations had had enormous problems when they had returned from the congress and the president had been asked to find a solution so that only one GP world championship would take place. Following the confusion in Christchurch, Dorna was no longer an FIM partner. Organisers had confirmed that they were not prepared to organise a GP without the assurance that the best riders would take part. Finally Mr Castiglione, the Cagiva boss, had requested that a meeting be held between the FIM president, the Deputy president and Mr Ecclestone on 15 November, in the presence of the CCR president. Numerous phone calls had been received at the secretariat from federations who had changed their minds. The unanimity reached in Christchurch had totally evaporated and the federations under pressure from their riders and organisers less inclined to pay the higher fees, had begun to show an interest in the IRTA/Ecclestone proposal. &&&&& &&&&& The Deputy president indicated that ''"the management council and general assembly decision had not aimed to refuse any form of collaboration, but to protect the authority and the power of the FIM and the FMNs"''. During a press conference in Italy, Mr Zerbi had explained that ''"the agreement signed in Barcelona was not acceptable, because it withdrew all FIM rights on the GPs"''. On this occasion, Mr Castiglione had intervened and had confirmed that a solution was vital and he proposed a meeting in London. The Deputy president emphasised that he was against the Barcelona agreement but for the London one. The executive board discussed the London agreement and agreed to request a few additions or modifications: &&&&& * TWP and Dorna would not organise any motorcycling event which was not under the auspices of the FIM &&&&& * Riders' licences had to be issued by the FIM &&&&& * The permanent board had to include a representative from the FIM and not necessarily the president &&&&& &&&&& A letter received from the Japanese federation and manufacturers ''"greeted the agreement signed in London, but requested that FIM regulations should be applied to the GPs"''. It also mentioned opposition to the limitation of 30 riders per class and the suggestion to accept new riders from every country. &&&&& &&&&& Concerning the MotoMedia contract, the FIM agreed to compensate ROPA if it accepted voluntarily to withdraw from the contract. The FIM lawyer was to prepare a cancellation document for signature by both parties. &&&&& &&&&& 1992: The start of a new era &&&&& The shock had been very great because the FIM role in the GPs was no longer as it had been. The negotiations continued between Messrs Golding and Ecclestone. The management council met in Geneva on 17 and 19 January with a meeting with the road racing organisers held on Saturday 18. &&&&& &&&&& The president outlined to the management council what had happened since the Christchurch congress – which everyone knew already, more or less. It emerged that most of the organisers were not in a position to fulfil the conditions imposed by Bernie Ecclestone which explained the absence of any calendar. The Japanese manufacturers were insisting that the FIM regulations should be applied to GPs. They emphasised that they would no longer supply machines if this were not the case. The first draft contract submitted by Mr Ecclestone had been refused. A meeting had been held on 10 January with Messrs Vaessen, Zerbi and Maitre and the FIM lawyer, Mr Vischer. A new proposal had been made and sent to Messrs Ecclestone and Golding who were to come to Geneva on 21 January to discuss it. The management council gave its approval to the signing of the London contract and its support to the president, but Mr Puig Bulto declared he was disappointed. ''"The London contract does not recognise the FIM’s sporting authority over the GPs"''. He requested that the federation's sporting and technical regulations should be applied ''"even though the IRTA regulations only differ slightly from those of the FIM"''. He also insisted that 36 riders should be accepted in each individual category. The council voted by 14 for and one against with one abstention to accept the strategy adopted after the congress and for the signature of a contract with Dorna/TWP. The contract with MotoMedia should be annulled in the shortest possible time. &&&&& &&&&& Another session of the council was held on 26 January 1992 after the meeting concerning the Dorna/TWP contract. The FIM would have to take some swift decisions. A new draft contract drawn up by Mr Vischer was distributed. In the meantime, another draft had been sent late on the 25th of January 1992 to Bernie Ecclestone. The president had met the representatives of IRTA and the regulations adopted in London had been revised. The title ''"FIM Regulations for the GP road racing world championship"'' was accepted. The FIM would publish these regulations in the form of a separate booklet. There would be no FIM official in the race direction. A system equivalent to the international jury (with three stewards) was accepted. The publication of the calendar was brought forward to 1 October. 36 riders instead of 30 were to be accepted in each class and from 1993 onwards, two FMNR riders would be able to take part in practice. The federation's disciplinary and arbitration code served as the basis for protests and appeals and not the ''"Series regulations"''. The FIM circuit standards had been accepted for 1992. Concerning the medical regulations, they had been accepted by Dr Kreutz (CM president). The president confirmed that any amendment to the regulations had to be approved by the permanent board. The FIM also had the right to propose amendments. As for the contract itself, one article was causing serious problems. If an FMN refused to send the registration of a GP, even if a contract had been signed between TWP and the organiser, the FIM would be charged with nominating another FMNR or to substitute itself for the FMNR to confirm this GP. The president remarked that this clause was the essential reason why he had assembled the management council since he had refused to accept this modification without its approval. The council accepted this clause unanimously with one abstention. The council also confirmed the mandate given to the president and the secretary general to sign the contract as long as no substantial changes were made in the meantime. &&&&& &&&&& The Geneva meetings took place from 28 February until 2 March. President Vaessen announced that the contract with TWP/Dorna had been signed and that the proposal for the statute amendments had been withdrawn from the agenda of the FIA general assembly with no discussion. The FIM had received several letters of support from the FMNs and one from the International motonautic association. The president indicated that in addition to the 36 riders per class plus two FMNR riders another change had been made. The permanent board had to give its approval for each official (not only from the FIM) appointed for more than four GPs. The secretary general emphasised that Swiss law was applicable to the contract (and no longer English), that the ownership of the championship and associated rights still belonged to the FIM and that the contract was for ten years but could be cancelled after five for reasons beyond the control of any of the parties. &&&&& &&&&& The president recalled that the Japanese manufacturers had sent a letter to Mr Métraux (IRTA) demanding that the number of riders for practice should be increased and that the FIM technical regulations should be applied without which they would not provide the machines for the GPs. Mr Puig Bulto said that there were very few differences between the technical regulations and that it was without doubt possible to find an agreement with the manufacturers and then to submit the modifications to TWP/Dorna. The return to priority lists was also discussed, but the selection criteria had become financial. The president reminded the meeting that the FIM could not take the decision alone and had to consult its new partners. A meeting was to be held between the FIM, the Japanese manufacturers and the IRTA on 4 March in Amsterdam to find agreement on the technical issues and the number of riders admitted for practice. &&&&& &&&&& The 1992 GP calendar was published on 28 February after approval by the council. The division of the contract revenue was discussed and approved for 1992. &&&&& &&&&& The next meeting took place on 20 and 21 June 1992. The MotoMedia contract had been cancelled on 31 December 1991. The CMS demands had been taken into account for the contract with the consortium. It was valid from 1992 onwards for the supercross world championship. &&&&& &&&&& Then the council members who had officiated at GPs presented their reports: ''"The stewards and safety officials appointed are respected by the organisers and the management committee. The responsibility of the FIM stewards has been reduced compared with the jury system. Relations are good between the various parties in particular with Mr Pierpaolo Gardella, event director. The technical director, Jack Findlay, appears to have everything under control"''. However, the following points could be improved: ''"Fuller information should be provided by the management committee to the FIM stewards who should be present at each GP before the start of practice. The stewards should receive copies of the riders’ entry forms"''. More important was the fact that directives for imposing fines should be established as well as an appeal guarantee and the costs for dismantling an engine. Finally ''"FIM officials should have access to all parts of the circuit including the press centre"''. The president believed that the sporting aspect which was the most important of all, had until now gone well. Other points had been the focus of bitter discussions, particular the points scored by some wild card riders (especially the Japanese in Suzuka). TWP/Dorna had had to intervene to have this point accepted. Following the meeting in Amsterdam between the FIM, the Japanese industry and IRTA, the manufacturers had managed to achieve that IRTA was not permitted to modify the technical regulations. The side-car class was causing problems. After long discussions between president Vaessen and IRTA representatives, it was agreed that there would be two practice sessions and the same race distance with the number of participants increased to 24. The FIM lawyer studied the contract in order to force TWP to respect its obligations or to submit the matter to an arbitration tribunal. The president had also informed TWP/Dorna that he would no longer discuss any change to the regulations without the agreement of his management council and insisted that only urgent changes should come into force during the current season. &&&&& &&&&& As for unleaded fuel, following meetings between the FIM, the industry and IRTA, it was decided that with the exception of track races and the supersport championship, the fuel used from 1993 onwards would be AVGAS 100 Low Lead (O,56 g/l), and from 1995 onwards unleaded fuel according to the European norm EN 228 (0,013 g/l) with additives forbidden. &&&&& &&&&& The executive board met on 8 and 9 August. After discussion it was decided that members of the commissions from ex-Yugoslavia or ex-USSR would be presented for election by the management council. Concerning the side-car class, the arrangement for 1993 and 1994 was for four races in Europe and one outside Europe. &&&&& &&&&& The working group for the ''"FIM headquarters"'' indicated that there were great difficulties in finding a suitable location since agents were reticent to sell taking into account the drop in property prices. Proposals had been made to move the FIM offices (Paris, Brussels, etc.) but the general assembly had decided in Christchurch that the offices should stay in Geneva or in the surroundings in spite of the difference in property prices. &&&&& &&&&& Mr Goss, the president of the international public affairs committee, indicated that the Single European Market would come into force on 1 January 1993. The FIM had to protect the sport and react on all subjects pertaining to motorcycle sport and traffic. The general assembly accepted the proposal to hire a professional consultant in Brussels – it would be EPPA, managed by Dr Stefan Schepers. The president also proposed to create an ''"environment"'' working group charged with developing an FIM policy to protect the environment. Finally, Mr Goss drew attention to the FIM declaration approved by the committee on the subject of homologation norms: ''"The FIM cannot support legislation which is not substantially documented by thorough research"''. &&&&& &&&&& An executive board session was held on 5 and 19 December 1992 in Geneva. The members met among others with Messrs Métraux, Butler and Trimby (IRTA) on the subject of the 1992 season which had in general gone well. Several subjects were discussed such as the need to normalise relations between the FIM and IRTA, the circuit inspection procedure and the possibility for IRTA to submit its own remarks to the FIM as well as the agreement from IRTA to demand that riders be members of their FMN before receiving a GP licence and the possible modification of the existing regulations. The problem of Japanese riders ought to be resolved by their elevation as members of IRTA with a contract from 1993 onwards. The IRTA also supported the idea of making the prize-giving ceremony compulsory by adding a clause in the contracts of each rider. The date of 17 December 1992 was chosen for this ceremony. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& After the conflicts were largely concluded in 1992, an alliance was formed between the FIM, the IRTA, the Motorcycle Sports Manufacturers' Association (MSMA) and Dorna Sport which stands until this day. The FIM is the sanctioning body of the Grand Prix Motorcycle Racing (now MotoGP World Championship) and is the overall governing body of motorcycling sport at a world level. It groups together 112 National Motorcycle Federations across six continents. The IRTA (International Road-Racing Teams Association) is the association of all the Grand Prix teams, representing their collective voice in the decision-making process. The organisation works alongside the FIM and Dorna to maintain high standards within Grand Prix Motorcycle Racing (now MotoGP), and improve the sport overall. Dorna Sports is the company at the heart of Grand Prix Motorcycle Racing (now MotoGP) that administrates and organises all Grands Prix. The company manages all commercial aspects of the sport and organises each event, with responsibilities ranging from marketing, media services, security, time-keeping and sponsorship co-ordination to TV production and promotion and the MSMA (Motorcycle Sports Manufacturers' Association) takes care of the interests of all the manufacturers involved in motorcycle racing. &&&&& &&&&& After Dorna had acquired the broadcast rights for all the motorcycle racing classes, the quality significantly improved. Before the takeover, the quality of the footage was significantly worse. The local national broadcaster was responsible for the production at each grand prix – and more or less muddled through the weekend as best they could. The winner crossing the finish line was often missed, graphics were incorrect, the director would stubbornly ignore the most gripping duels and some corners did not even have a camera. &&&&& &&&&& Bernie Ecclestone collaborated with Dorna in the 1992 season and managed to acquire the commercial rights of the sports, but eventually sold them off quietly to Dorna Sports for 50 million Pounds in 1993. During the 1992 season, Bernie would create strangulation contracts and propose those to the organisers of the grands prix venues, which forced them to double the ticket prices. A few years ago, Bernie did the same thing with the 1990 Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix with the result that ticket sales plummeted and that eventually signed the beginning of the end for the Belgian round, as it was scrapped from the 1991 calendar onwards. &&&&& &&&&& Ecclestone would however, still remain active in the promotion of the German motorcycle Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. He invested a lot of money in the promotion of the venue, but the "high-class fans" he wanted to visit the race never came and due to his strangulation contract he had with the venue, he did not make profits until the end of the 5-year contract. Ecclestone continues to have good relations with Carmelo Ezpeleta and the rest of the Dorna Sports team. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * FISA–FOCA war &&&&& * FIA–FOTA dispute &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

97	Estradiol_anthranilate
Estradiol anthranilate &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Estradiol anthranilate''', or '''estradiol 3-anthranilate''', is a synthetic estrogen and estrogen ester – specifically, the C3 anthranilic acid ester of estradiol – which was described in the late 1980s and was never marketed. In dogs, the oral bioavailability of estradiol anthranilate was found to be 5-fold higher than that of unmodified estradiol. However, a subsequent study found that the oral bioavailability of estradiol and estradiol anthranilate did not differ considerably in rats (4.3% and 3.2%, respectively), suggestive of a major species difference. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * List of estrogen esters § Estradiol esters &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

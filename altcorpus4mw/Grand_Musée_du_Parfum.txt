The museum, developed over two years for $7 million, was Iocated in the ''hôtel particulier'' (townhouse mansion) at 73, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, once the residence of the Roederer champagne family and later the location of fashion house Christian Lacroix. Entry cost between 5 and 14.50 Euro. Exhibits included a recreation of the laboratory of French perfume house Houbigant (founded in 1775 at 19, rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré), using items on loan from the Musée Carnavalet (the museum of the history of Paris). It also had a "garden of scent" with white sculptures that each released different scents. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

GSR Class 342 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Great Southern Railways (GSR) Class 342''' consisted of five 4-4-0 locomotives built by Inchicore railway works in 1936. They were a late follow on from the '''GSR Class 333''' originally built by the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR) in 1907/1908. &&&&& &&&&& Design and modifications &&&&& The locomotives were essentially modelled on the 1927 rebuild of Locomotive 338 of Class 333. The driving wheels and less than 16 long ton maximum axle load were suitable for go anywhere and secondary passenger and mixed duties as opposed to the  driving wheels of classes 301 through 321 which were more suited to express passenger work. &&&&& &&&&& Service &&&&& In practice all members of these classed were treated interchangeably for operational purposes. A maximum axle load allowed the class to be used almost anywhere. They were assessed in 1948 as quite powerful and fast and especially useful for passenger specials. &&&&& &&&&& ===Loan to GNRI=== &&&&& In 1946 Locomotive 346 which was an oil burner at the time was lent to the Great Northern Railway (GNRI) to operate the Dublin-Bundoran express as far as Dundalk. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Gertrude was heiress of Bentheim and Rheineck. She married first Siegfried I of Weimar-Orlamünde and then Otto I, Count of Salm. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Gertrude was born around 1090. She was the daughter of Henry, Margrave of Frisia and Gertrude of Brunswick, daughter of Egbert I of Meissen. Gertrude had two full siblings: Otto III of Northeim, who succeeded her father, and Richenza, who married the future Emperor Lothair II.

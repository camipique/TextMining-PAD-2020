98	Germochus
Germochus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& St Germoe's chair &&&&& &&&&& Saint '''Germochus''' or '''Germoe''' is the patron saint of the parish of Germoe in Cornwall. He is said to have been a king and one of the companions of St Breage (they were Irish missionaries who landed at Hayle). His shrine in Germoe church was a place of pilgrimage until the Reformation. In the churchyard is St Germoe's Chair, no doubt connected to the cult of the saint but in what way is unclear.

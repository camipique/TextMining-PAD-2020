Homestead Dolgorukovy — Bobrinsky &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Homestead Dolgorukovy — Bobrinsky''' () is a city manor in Moscow (Malaya Nikitskaya Street, 12). Built at the end of the 18th century. Belonged to the princes Dolgorukov and Count Bobrinsky. The estate has the status of an object of cultural heritage of federal significance. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The manor complex was built in the late 18th century by Prince Andrey Nikolaevich Dolgorukov on the basis of the Chambers. Later, the owner of the house became the councilor-in-arms Prokopii Fedorovich Sokovnin (1786-1819). Then the house was inherited by his daughter Sofya Prokopievna Sokovnina (1812-1869). In 1830, she married Count Vasily Alekseevich Bobrinsky (1804-1874), and the estate was given to him as a dowry. Later, the estate was inherited by their son, the Moscow provincial leader of the nobility and a member of the State Council, Alexei Vasilievich Bobrinsky (1831-1888). His son, ethnographer Alexei Alekseyevich Bobrinsky (1861-1938), became the last owner of the estate. &&&&& &&&&& At the end of the 19th century - beginning of the twentieth century, the main house was leased to the gymnasium of A.V. Adolf. In the Soviet era, the estate buildings were occupied by various institutions. In 2010 the estate was transferred to the Presidential Center of Boris N. Yeltsin. After carrying out restoration works, it is planned to place the museum-exhibition complex, library and restaurant. &&&&& &&&&& Architecture &&&&& Left wing &&&&& The manor complex includes a three-story main house and two-story side wings facing the red line of Malaya Nikitskaya Street.

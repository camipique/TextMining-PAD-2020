Fernando Balda &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Fernando Marcelo Balda Flores''' is an Ecuadorian politician who claimed he was abducted in July 2012 in Bogotá, Colombia, where he had fled because in 2009 he had turned from supporting the Ecuadorian government and member of parliament for Alianza País to opposition member of the party Partido Sociedad Patriótica (PSP, in English: Patriotic Society Party) and was accused of having been involved in a failed coup in 2010. Ecuador is asking for its former president Rafael Correa to be extradited from Belgium for involvement in the abduction. Balda was deported from Colombia to Ecuador in October 2012 to serve a prison sentence. He is married and has four children. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

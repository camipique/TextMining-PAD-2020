Elly Pamatong &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Ragen Elly Velez Lao Pamatong''' (also spelled '''Ely Pamatong''') is a Filipino lawyer, politician, and the self-proclaimed President of the Philippines known for his attempts to participate in Philippine elections. Pamatong was declared a nuisance candidate twice for his attempted candidacy for president in 2004 and 2010 by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). &&&&& &&&&& Legal career &&&&& The Supreme Court of the Philppines suspended Pamatong in 2016, after criticizing Judge Gregorio Pantonosas Jr. Pamatong has called on the high court to reverse the decision. &&&&& &&&&& He also joined the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and served as the legal counsel of MNLF founder Nur Misuari, but the MNLF later cut ties with him following the spike attacks he incited in 2004. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Pamatong attempted to run for president in the 2004 and 2010 Philippine elections but his candidacy was not accepted with the Commission on Elections declaring him as a nuisance candidate for both elections. In 2007, he ran for the position of Governor of Pampanga but lost to Ed Panlilio. &&&&& &&&&& USAFFE &&&&& Elly Pamatong leads his own organization called the United States Allied Freedom Fighters of the East (USAFFE; not to be confused with the United States Army Forces in the Far East). According to himself, the organization is a "anti-communist paramilitary organization" meant to oppose the New People's Army in Mindanao. The organization has been described by the media as a far-right group. Pamatong holds the rank of "five star general" within the group. &&&&& &&&&& Pamatong's USAFFE was established in 2003 and was based on a compound in Cagayan de Oro owned by Edmundo Pamintuan who was a client of Pamatong as a lawyer who lead the Back to Christ Discovery Crusade group. When Pamintuan died in 2002, Pamatong recruited members of the Christ Discovery Crusade as part of his USAFFE, which he claims to be a holdover of the original United States Army Forces in the Far East of World War II. The compound was raided in 2017 by the Martial Law Special Action Group in coordination with several other security government authorities and confiscated firearms and explosives. &&&&& &&&&& The USAFFE was allegedly involved in a plot to bomb the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in 2014 and Pamatong was arrested for his suspected involvement. The group also plotted to bomb the SM Mall of Asia, the Chinese Embassy and the headquarters D.M. Consunji Inc. which employs hundreds of Chinese. &&&&& &&&&& In January 2019, Pamatong burned the flags of China and Malaysia on two separate occasions on behalf of his group. He burned the Chinese flag as protest against the "economic colonisation" and "dismemberment" of the Philippines by the People's Republic of China. His actions towards the Malaysian flag was a protest against what he calls the "continuing invasion" of Sabah by Malaysia. The action caused diplomatic process against the Philippine government over the matter with the latter stating Pamatong's actions as not reflective of the country's official stance. &&&&& &&&&& Protests &&&&& Pamatong called on his supporters to spread spikes on roads as a protest against corruption of the administration of then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as well as refusal of government authorities to issue him and his supporters permit to organize a rally. Spikes were spread on major roads in Metro Manila, Baguio, Bicol, Cagayan, Davao, and Laguna. &&&&& &&&&& Lawsuits filed by Pamatong &&&&& Pamatong has filed cases numerous lawsuits against high-profile individuals. Such persons include then-Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales for "alleged disturbance of public order, swindling and teaching immoral doctrines." He also filed disqualification case against Lito Lapid and Manny Paquiao who were running for the post of Senator in the 2010 Philippine elections saying that the candidates didn't have enough educational experience but the Commission on Elections dismissed Pamatong's petition stating that there is no need for candidates to have a high educational attainment to be eligible to run. &&&&& &&&&& An outspoken critic of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, Pamatong filed a ''quo warranto'' petition before the Supreme Court in June 2018. He seeks to oust Duterte, on the grounds that his certificate of candidacy in the 2016 presidential election was illegal. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

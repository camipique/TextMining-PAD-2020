Guilt Trip (song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Guilt Trip'''" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West, which lies on his sixth solo studio album ''Yeezus'' (2013). It was produced by West, Mike Dean, S1, Travis Scott and Ackeejuice Rockers. The song includes uncredited vocals from Kid Cudi, who felt negatively about his feature. The song had the lowest debut from the album in the United States out of all of the album's tracks. &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& "Guilt Trip" samples the songs "Chief Rocka" by Lords of the Underground and "Blocka" by Pusha T featuring Popcaan & Travis Scott within it. The song's outro is sung by Kid Cudi. West raps the line: "Star Wars' fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca", which is one of multiple times that ''Star Wars'' has been referenced in music. &&&&& &&&&& Release and reception &&&&& "Guilt Trip" was released on June 18, 2013, as the eighth track on West's sixth studio album ''Yeezus''. In February 2014, Cudi revealed negative feelings about his feature being released as part of the album, due to the vocals being a few years old. Within October of the same year, it was revealed that the track was originally intended to be released on West's collaboration album ''Watch the Throne'' (2011) with Jay-Z and a version exists with both of them rapping over the beat. &&&&& &&&&& The melody at the end of the song was described by Lou Reed of ''The Guardian'' as: 'so beautiful, it makes me so emotional, it brings tears to my eyes'. When comparing the track to "Blood on the Leaves", ''Popdust'' described it as being: 'even closer to the "Say You Will" or "See You in My Nightmares" feel of West's ''808s & Heartbreak'' LP'. &&&&& &&&&& When ''Complex'' listed the best collaborations between West and Cudi in August 2017, "Guilt Trip" was positioned at number two. &&&&& &&&&& Live performances &&&&& The track was part of West's set list when he performed the first concert at the Barclays Center in New York City on The Yeezus Tour. It was performed live by him during this tour at the New Orleans Arena, with anonymous female figures braiding themselves around West. &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& On the same week that ''Yeezus'' was released, the song peaked at number 2 on the US ''Billboard'' Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart and remained on it for a total of two weeks. By charting at this position, it had the lowest debut in the United States out of any of the album's songs. &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2013) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US On-Demand Songs (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 39 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

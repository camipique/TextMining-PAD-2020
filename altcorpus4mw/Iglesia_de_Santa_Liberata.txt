Iglesia de Santa Liberata &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& thumb &&&&& The '''Iglesia de Santa Liberata''' is a Catholic church located in Alameda de los Descalzos in Rímac District, Lima, Lima Region, Peru. &&&&& &&&&& Church built in 1716. In 1745 the ''Cruciferous Fathers of Good Death'' took over the church. They made many improvements and were distinguished by their religious fervor by attracting neighbors. This order was there until 1826. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In the place where the religious complex currently stands, there existed, before the construction of the church, an oranges' orchard. On January 20 of 1711, a priest was introduced to the priest of the Tabernacle, located on the left side of the Cathedral of Lima, asking him to allow him to seek his certificate of baptism in the parish books. The presbyter agreed gladly, because in addition the applicant apparently was of good manners and customs; but it is the case that in a small distraction of the parish priest, because of his extreme trust in the faithful, the golden ciborium containing the consecrated hosts for the various churches of Lima had disappeared. &&&&& &&&&& No one had noticed what happened, until once, they needed it and that was the day January 30, when it required to administer the per diem to a dying man, giving himself with the great surprise that the ciborium was not in his place, which caused that a great revolt was armed in all the population, due to the sacrilegious incident, the ecclesiastical authorities decide to close all the temples of the capital and suspend the administration of the Eucharist. Lima was left without Masses and without the sacrament of communion. In order to take the thief, the then Viceroy of Peru; Diego Ladrón de Guevara, orders to go after the criminal, in a tenacious pursuit by sheriffs, officers and offices, among other measures that were within his reach. &&&&& &&&&& Soon, the sacrilegious thief was captured when he tried to sell him the stones that adorned the ciborium to a pulpero; don Jaime Alvítez, who denounces the fact to the authorities. Under the pressure of the same, the thief named: Fernando Hurtado de Chávez, confessed that he had buried the relic wrapped in a paper next to an orange tree in one of the bushes, near the Alameda de los Descalzos. The surprising thing was that, although the hole was full of mud and water, the 150 hosts inside were clean. Two years later the Iglesia de Santa Liberata was built there. The main altar is located above the hole where the hosts were found. The religious building was named Santa Liberata, for being the patron of the native town of the viceroy, the Spanish city of Sigüenza. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

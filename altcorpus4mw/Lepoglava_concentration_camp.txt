Lepoglava concentration camp &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Lepoglava concentration camp''' was concentration camp in the Independent State of Croatia during the World War II. It was located 25 km southwest of Varaždin and operated by Ustaše. In terms of atrocities against its inmates, this camp was no different than other concentration camps in Croatia. In July 1943 it was briefly captured by Yugoslav Partisans. In March and April 1945 about 1,300 inmates of Lepoglava were transported to Jasenovac where they all were killed. In Lepoglava on 30 April 1945 Ustaše murdered 961 young people near the camp, mostly students. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& &&&&& The Lepoglava prison was established penitentiary of Austria-Hungary in mid-19th century. It served as prison in all countries that succeeded it, i.e. Yugoslavia (1918—41) and Croatia (since 1992). During the World War II this prison was transformed into the camp. &&&&& &&&&& Concentration camp &&&&& &&&&& The Lepoglava camp was not different from other concentration camp in Croatia regarding the atrocities against its inmates. Its organizational structure was similar to the organizational structure of Jasenovac extermination camp, it had its commander with administrative, labor, economy and security departments. Commanders of Lepoglava camp were Ljubo Miloš, Miro Natijević and Nikola Gađić. Its first members included Jews who were after their arrival to the camp supported by the Jewish community of Zagreb which sent them food, clothing and medicine. &&&&& &&&&& === Short Partisan takeover in July 1943 === &&&&& &&&&& Some Partisan units requested an approval from the Croatian Partisan Headquarter to attack Jasenovac extermination camp and release its inmates, first in July 1943 and then in August 1943. The Croatian Headquarter refused this requests both times. When the Croatian Partisan Headquarter refused this request in July 1943 their reply contained a proposition to attack Lepoglava camp instead of Jasenovac. This proposition was accepted. &&&&& &&&&& The Partisan forces captured Lepoglava on 14 July 1943, intentionally on the Bastille Day. The communists first attacked the camp with artillery and then charged it with infantry. On the day when it was captured by communists, the commander of the camp was Mirko Cvitkovac. About 15% of its inmates were communists who joined Partisans after they captured the camp. &&&&& &&&&& This was the most important action of the Partisans in the North-West Croatia. &&&&& &&&&& === Under control of the Ustasha Surveillance Service === &&&&& After the communist capture of Lepoglava camp, Croatian forces recaptured it and put it under control of Bureau 3 within the Ustasha Surveillance Service and Ljubo Miloš as commander of the camp at the beginning of 1944. &&&&& &&&&& In 1945 Ustaše decided to move inmates to Jasenovac extermination camp because they considered existing location as insecure. &&&&& &&&&& Croatia decided to close the camp at the beginning of 1945 and transported 1,300 of its inmates to Jasenovac extermination camp until the end of March 1945. All of them were killed in Jasenovac except around 50 inmates who managed to escape during the transport. On 30 April 1945 Ustaše killed about 80 inmates who remained in the camp and 961 young people, mostly students on the locality near camp which is today known as Memorial Cemetery (). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

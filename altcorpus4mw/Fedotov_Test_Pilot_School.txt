Fedotov Test Pilot School &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Fedotov Test Pilot School''' or '''FTPS''' (''''' or ''''') is one of two test pilot schools in Russia (the other one is a military test pilot school in Akhtubinsk). The school was established in 1947 when Russia was part of the USSR and is named after Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov, a test pilot who was killed in an aircraft crash in the 1980s. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The school was established in 1947 at the Soviet Union's Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky near Moscow, to train personnel involved in conducting test flights primarily within the Russian aviation industry. They underwent theoretical and practical training to allow safe and effective flight testing of the aircraft and on-board equipment. Initially there were three departments: for training test pilots for fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft; and air navigators to be employed by the Soviet design bureaus (OKB), research institutes (like GFRI, etc.) and production plants. Later, with completion of the initial training schedules, such separation became less formalized. There also were special classes for training test pilots to serve as civil aviation research and testing personnel working for the GosNII GA. &&&&& &&&&& The school is named after Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov. The school was renamed in 1984 after Fedotov died in a test flight accident that year. &&&&& &&&&& Training &&&&& Currently, FTPS is licensed by the ministry of education as an additional professional education establishment and provides training for test pilots and navigators, flight test engineers and operators involved in flight testing, as well as the air traffic controllers and maintenance engineers. The course curriculum for aircrew training is divided into two major components: theory of flight and flight testing; simulators and flight training. &&&&& &&&&& Fixed and rotary wing aircraft are available for training from the fleet of the Gromov Flight Research Institute. International students who have attended the course or subsets of the full course include mostly pilots, from China, France, Laos, the United Kingdom and the United States. &&&&& &&&&& Heads of the school &&&&& * (1947–1953) &&&&& * Nickolay Darsky (1954–1955) &&&&& * Ivan Polunin (1955–1961) &&&&& * Alexandr Rozanov (1961–1969) &&&&& * Lev Fomenko (1970–1974) &&&&& * (1974–1988) &&&&& * (1988–1989) &&&&& * Vladimir Kondratenko (1989–2012) &&&&& * (since 2013) &&&&& &&&&& Notable alumni &&&&& * Anatoly Kvochur &&&&& * Viktor Korostiyev &&&&& * Anatoli Levchenko &&&&& * Leonid Lobas &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * Svetlana Savitskaya &&&&& * Rimantas Stankevičius &&&&& * Ural Sultanov &&&&& * Pavel Vlasov &&&&& * Igor Volk &&&&& * Ruben Yesayan &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Training the test pilots &&&&& * 70th anniversary of the Fedotov Test Pilot School &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of test pilot schools &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

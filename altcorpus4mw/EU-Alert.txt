1283	EU-Alert
EU-Alert &&&&& Introduction &&&&& EU-Alert/NL-Alert Cell Broadcast message in the area of Venlo, The Netherlands on 7 August 2018 as a result of a large toxic fire &&&&& '''EU-Alert''' is the generic term for the European Public Warning Service. &&&&& EU-Alert is compatible with Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) formerly known as the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) standard as used in the United States. All mobile phones OS (Android, IOS and Windows) since 2012 by default support EU-Alert/WEA/CMAS via Cell Broadcast for public warning messages. &&&&& &&&&& EU standards &&&&& The EU-Alert standard (TS 102 900 V1.2.1) as defined by ETSI is the European Public Warning Service using the Cell Broadcast Service as a means of delivering public warning messages to the general public. &&&&& &&&&& Specific countries using the EU-Alert service are identified by replacing the letters EU with the Country Identification letters in ISO 3166-1 : &&&&& &&&&& * NL-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for the Netherlands. &&&&& * LT-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Lithuania. &&&&& * RO-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Romania. &&&&& &&&&& Dependent on the country legislation there are 5 types of Public Warning Service (PWS) messages one can receive on the mobile device. They're grouped into Cell Broadcast headings and channels, and include: &&&&& * Extreme threats: Classified as threats to your life and property, like an impending catastrophic weather event like a hurricane or a terrorist attack. &&&&& * Severe threats: Less serious than the extreme threats, these could be the same types of situations, but on a smaller scale — stay safe, but no need to pack up the car and head for the hills. &&&&& * EU-Amber, AMBER alerts: These are specific alerts aimed at locating a missing child. &&&&& * EU-Info, Public Safety Messages to convey essential, recommended actions that can save lives or property (e.g. emergency shelter locations or a boil water order). &&&&& * EU-Exercise, Test messages for national/regional/local purposes. &&&&& &&&&& In countries that have selected Cell Broadcast as the technology to submit public warning messages up to 70%- 85% of the population older than 12 year receive the public warning verification message within seconds after the government authorities have submitted the message see as an example Emergency Mobile Alert (New Zealand), NL-Alert (Netherlands) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (USA). Cell Broadcast is since 2012 supported by the default messaging app in Android, IOS and Windows 10. &&&&& &&&&& EU Legislation &&&&& As per 11 December 2018 the Council of the European Union has adapted the new Directive on European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). Under the new Directive, all EU member states will also have to set up a public warning system to protect citizens. This system will send alerts to all citizens and visitors mobile phones in a specific area in the event of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other major emergency in their area. &&&&& &&&&& The mandatory implementation of the public warning system will have to be in place by 21 June 2022 for each EU member state ( Full text of the European Electronic Communications Code). &&&&& &&&&& BEREC guidelines &&&&& According to the Article 110(2) EECC, by 21st June 2020, BEREC must publish guidelines on how to assess whether the effectiveness of public warning systems under Article 110(2) EECC is equivalent to the effectiveness of those systems under the Article 110(1) EECC. &&&&& &&&&& Alternative solutions &&&&& &&&&& Possible alternative for EU-Alert to use other electronic communications services, such as apps. However several conditions must be met according to the new European Electronic Communications Code Legislation: &&&&& &&&&& * As efficient as network-based technologies &&&&& * Reception of the alert should be easy &&&&& * Information to all visitors entering the country &&&&& * Transmission of the alert is free to the user &&&&& * Comply with privacy rules &&&&& &&&&& === Downloadable Mobile Applications === &&&&& &&&&& There are several downloadable mobile applications on the market that often warn on natural catastrophes; however, these are often not of official, but part of private initiatives that replicate information from state agencies . &&&&& &&&&& All Downloadable Mobile applications have the issue that they are highly affected by traffic load as they required mobile data usage; therefore, especially in case of a disaster when load spikes of Data (Social media, Voice and Mobile app), tend to significantly slowdown mobile networks, as multiple events showed e.g. 2016 Brussels bombings, November 2015 Paris attacks, 2017 London Bridge attack, Manchester Arena bombing, 2017 Stockholm attack and 2016 Munich shooting. &&&&& &&&&& Moreover downloadable Mobile Apps needs to be downloaded by subscribers and the experience over the years in many countries is that only a fraction of the population will take the effort to download and use an Emergency Mobile app that is only activated a few times in a year. Examples are in Germany with 1.500.000 downloads of the Katwarn and NINA mobile application reaching a maximum of 2.5M people in Germany (<3% of the German population) and France only 500.000 downloads of the SAIP mobile application (<1% of the French population) despite large investments in application development and marketing. In France because of the limited success of the downloadable Mobile App SAIP (Système d’Alerte et d’Information des Populations) the service has been stopped as of June 2018 . &&&&& &&&&& === Location based SMS === &&&&& The use of Location Based SMS as an emergency notification service instead of Cell Broadcast is not advised by industry experts. &&&&& Location based SMS message delivery is not guaranteed, and the implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered in a timely manner especially when network congestion occurs at the time of an emergency . &&&&& Based upon last years experience the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency concluded in a recent report that in case of serious events it's extremely unlikely that Public Warning Messages via SMS will work and will be delivered in a timely manner (less than 1 minute). &&&&& &&&&& Additional disadvantages to use location based SMS in national public warning systems are: &&&&& &&&&& * Delivery time of Location Based SMS warning messages to groups of people in the Geo-target area is long (up to several hours e.g. in the Sweden case). &&&&& * Complex, expensive and non-standardized/proprietary integrations are required to obtain network based location feeds for every mobile operator for every subscriber (MSISDN) in the geo target area. &&&&& * Severe constrains by privacy legislation as for location based SMS the government need location and MSISDN of each subscriber and is therefore not compliant with the latest EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), see January 2019 hack of the SMS based Emergency Alert Australia system, mobile numbers (MSISDN) were stolen out off the Australian Emergency Alert database and thousands received a hacked SMS notification about their personal data . &&&&& * No unique and intrusive sound is available for warning SMS, resulting that warning SMS message from the government is received with the same sound as any regular SMS. &&&&& * SMS alerts are single shot messages, SMS alert messages are not repeated in the disaster area for a period of time. &&&&& * No functionality is available when SMS is used to submit different guidance to safety message to subscribers moving from one geo-target area to the other geo-target area. &&&&& * Only 1 severity level is available resulting that Amber alerts and test messages are received with the same severity level as for example fire or Tsunami warnings. &&&&& * No control or configuration is available for a subscriber on their Android and IOS handsets for national public warning alert messages using SMS. &&&&& * SMS alerts regarding public safety emergencies can be sent by everybody (no exclusivity) and forwarded by everybody (no control). &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Cell Broadcast &&&&& *Reverse 1-1-2 &&&&& *NL-Alert (Netherlands) &&&&& *Wireless Emergency Alerts (USA) &&&&& *Alert Ready (Canada) &&&&& *Emergency Mobile Alert (New Zealand) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

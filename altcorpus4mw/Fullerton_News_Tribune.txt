Fullerton News Tribune &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''''Fullerton News Tribune''''' was once the oldest continuously published independent daily newspaper in Orange County, California. Since a 1992 sale to Freedom Newspapers, its operations have been folded into the Orange County Register. The ''Register'' is currently a property of Digital First Media. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Founded by Edgar Johnson with 300 subscribers in 1891, the newspaper was first published as the ''Weekly Tribune of Orange County.'' By 1914 it had moved to daily publication. &&&&& &&&&& The ''News Tribune'' name was the product of the 1926 merger of the Fullerton News and Daily Tribune. After the merger, the News Tribune was sold just three years later for $125,000 to W. Kee Maxwell in 1929.  &&&&& &&&&& In the early part of the 20th century, the News Tribune was one of the more modern news organizations; it was the first California newspaper to print on Linotype presses, and the first small city daily in Southern California to have leased a telegraphic wire service. &&&&& &&&&& The paper was sold to Edgar F. Elstrom in 1939, who had worked as secretary to newspaper magnate E.W. Scripps The News Tribune grew in circulation over the next 30 years. The News Tribune was distributed 6 times a week in Fullerton, Brea, Placentia, Yorba Linda, La Habra, Buena Park, and a small nothern section of Anaheim. The News Tribune switched from hot lead linotype processing of press plates to cold type in the summer of 1973. &&&&& &&&&& After deciding to retire, Edgar Elfstrom sold the News Tribune to Scripps-Howard Newspapers in December 1973, the paper experienced declines in readership, and in consultation with its parent company cut nearly 25 full time staff in 1983, reduced coverage area, and finally went to weekly publication in 1985. Until it moved to a weekly publication schedule in 1985 it had been Orange County's longest running daily newspaper. It was purchased in 1987 by Community Media Enterprises. In 1992 it was sold to Freedom Newspapers for an undisclosed sum. Freedom Newspapers also owned the ''Orange County Register'' and the Fullerton paper became a local edition of the larger ''Register''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

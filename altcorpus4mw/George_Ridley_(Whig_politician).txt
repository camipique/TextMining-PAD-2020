George Ridley (Whig politician) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''George Ridley''' (1818 – 4 November 1887) was a British Liberal and Whig politician. &&&&& &&&&& The son of former Newcastle-upon-Tyne Whig MP Matthew Ridley and Laura née Hawkins, Ridley followed his father into politics, also as a Whig MP. After unsuccessfully contesting South Northumberland in 1852, he was elected for his father's former seat at a by-election in 1856—caused by the resignation of John Blackett due to ill health—and, becoming a Liberal in 1859, held the seat until 1860, when he resigned after being appointed a Copyhold, Inclosure and Tithe Commissioner. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

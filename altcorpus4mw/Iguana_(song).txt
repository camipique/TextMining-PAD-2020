1094	Iguana_(song)
Iguana (song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Iguana'''" is a song recorded by Romanian singer Inna. It was digitally released on 30 November 2018 as the second single for her upcoming sixth studio album ''Yo'' (2019) by Global Records and Roc Nation, although already made available for streaming and radio airplay earlier that month. "Iguana" was written by the singer and Cristina Maria Chiluiza, while production was solely handled by David Ciente. Musically the uptempo track was described as being club and salsa-influenced, extending Inna's change in direction introduced with "Ra" (2018). During its Spanish language lyrics, Inna discusses jealousy and lovesickness. &&&&& &&&&& Upon its release, "Iguana" was well-received by music critics who noticed its catchiness and praised Inna's emotional vocal delivery. An accompanying music video was premiered on Inna's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's digital release and was directed by Bogdan Păun. During the clip, the singer is shown at a night fiesta in an intoxicated state—as speculated by a reviewer—fighting back for her alleged love interest who resides with another woman at an outside bar. Further promoted by live performances in Romania and Mexico, "Iguana" reached number four on Romania's Airplay 100 chart. &&&&& &&&&& Background and composition &&&&& "Iguana" was written by Inna and Cristina Maria Chiluiza, while production was solely handled by David Ciente; he also engineered the song and Max Kissaru provided mixing and mastering. In July 2018, the track alongside three fellow ones from Inna's sixth studio album ''Yo'' (2019) were released as promotional singles in Romania; for a Coca-Cola campaign, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar bottles were designed with QR codes that—when scanned with a smartphone—linked to Shazam, allowing users to stream the four songs. Originally it was announced that "Iguana" would be released as ''Yo'' second single on 16 November 2018, but plans were scrapped; nonetheless it was made available for streaming by Roc Nation and was sent to Romanian radio stations around that date. "Iguana" digital release followed on 30 December 2018 and was also conducted by Roc Nation (by Global Records in Romania), with listeners being able to pre-order the single. &&&&& &&&&& Musically, "Iguana" is club and salsa-influenced and a more uptempo track than its predecessor "Ra" (2018), but extends Inna's change in direction introduced with the latter. It starts "gentle and rhythmically whilst Inna goes in hard with her lyrics" until the refrain is reached; there, club beats are introduced and the singer powerfully repeats the line "Sigo bailando sin ti" ("I keep dancing without you"). During the song's Spanish language lyrics, Inna implies an empowerment message and discusses on a jealous and lovesick woman who ultimately learns to continue enjoying her life without her love interest. ''Bllboard'' noted "deafening beats and introspective lyrics" during the track, and pointed out that although "'no reservations' seems to be Inna's mantra, ... a velvety croon of desolation flows throughout the song." &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Upon its release, "Iguana" was received with positive reviews from music critics. ''Cancan'' magazine praised the song's dance nature and Inna's energetic attitude, while both Mike Wass of Idolator and CelebMix's Jonathan Currinn called the track catchy. The latter also noted Inna's "most passionate vocals to date, truly meaning every single word". ''Billboard'' included "Iguana" in their Best Music Picks Of the Week list for the week ending 30 November 2018, praising Inna's "flawless" Spanish pronunciation and noting the song as a "daring and frisky tune". Commercially, "Iguana" debuted at number 91 on Romania's Airplay 100 chart for the week ending 25 November 2018, and rose 54 places to number 37 the next edition, as the highest climber. It has since then peaked at number four. &&&&& &&&&& Music video and promotion &&&&& reviewer, she is portrayed in an intoxicated state. &&&&& An accompanying music video for "Iguana" was originally announced to be released on 16 November 2018 by a teaser that had since been deleted. Another two previews were uploaded onto Inna's YouTube channel on 26 and 29 November 2018, respectively, with the music video released on 30 November 2018. It had already been broadcast by Romanian TV channels for several days beforehand. Produced by Loops Production, Bogdan Păun was the video's director and Alexandru Mureșan was hired as the director of photography; Andra Manea performed make-up, Sorin Stratulat hair styling and RDStyling brought the outfits used. One scene in the music video shows product placement of a Coca-Cola Zero Sugar bottle. &&&&& &&&&& During the music video, Inna is shown alongside another woman at a night fiesta in a crowd of "intermingling" and "enthusiastic" people. A critic described the place where the video was shot as a "Latin American village". Wearing a reversible sequined jacket—which reads the phrase "Rest in Peace" on its back—over floral underwear paired with trainers, the singer stumbles "hazily, possibly from a night out" and "probably drunk", encountering her "lost love" which resides with another woman at an outside bar. Inna walks towards them trying to "claim... ownership of her love", but is met with rejection and pulled away by her accompany; yet she continues to sing the song to them. Interspersed shots show her on a stage in front of ''Wilburn & Sons Wagon And Blacksmith Shop'' with a backup band, where she performs to the song and tosses her hair back and forth; she "does not let the incident ruin her night" as she repeatedly affirms that she will continue dancing, even if her love interest is not with her. Other scenes show "Inna's point of view, establishing what she's seeing in her intoxicated state". &&&&& &&&&& ''Billboard'' pointed out that Inna showed an "all-around bold attitude" during the music video. Europa FM called the clip a mixture of Spanish singers Nathy Peluso and Beatriz Luengo's works. For further promotion of "Iguana", the singer delivered a live performance of the track alongside "Ra" and "Cola Song" (2014) at the 2018 Telehit Awards in Mexico City on 7 November 2018. Inna eventually also appeared on Kiss FM to perform the single; Currinn of CelebMix spoke highly of her vocal performance, considering it superior to the studio track and writing that "she has literally managed to blow us away, ... her vocal ability is definitely impressive and intricate, considering how technical this song is". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& *'''Digital download''' &&&&& #"Iguana" – 2:41 &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018–2019) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Romania (Airplay 100) &&&&& &&&&& 4 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Release history &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Territory &&&&& &&&&& Date &&&&& &&&&& Format(s) &&&&& &&&&& Label &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Various &&&&& &&&&& November 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Global /Roc Nation &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 30 November 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Digital download &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

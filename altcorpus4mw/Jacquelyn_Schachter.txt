Jacquelyn Schachter &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jacquelyn Schachter''' (died on October 22, 2011) was professor emerita of linguistics at the University of Oregon. She received her Ph.D. in 1971 from UCLA, with a dissertation entitled, "Presuppositional and Counterfactual Conditional Sentences." &&&&& Career &&&&& Schachter taught at the University of Southern California from 1971 to 1991 before taking up a position at the University of Oregon in 1991. At Oregon she was the Director of the American English Institute and a Linguistics Department faculty until she retired in 1999. &&&&& Research &&&&& Dr. Schachter's primary research field was second language acquisition (SLA), investigating the role of Universal Grammar in conditioning patterns of SLA. Her work showed a lasting concern with methodological issues in second language research. (See e.g. Schachter 1998). She also had research interests in cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics. &&&&& &&&&& Schachter contributed to the fields of TESOL and SLA by coediting two important volumes of readings, Robinett and Schachter (1983) and Gass and Schachter (1989). In addition, she edited a book series for Lawrence Erlbaum Associates entitled ''Second Language Acquisition Research: Theoretical and Methodological Issues''. &&&&& &&&&& She was the editor of the conference proceedings for the international TESOL conferences of 1978â€“80 and the editor of the ''TESOL Quarterly'' from June 1978 to 1982. &&&&& &&&&& One of her daughters, Jana DeMeire, was lost in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 in 1998. &&&&& &&&&& Selected Publications &&&&& Gass, Susan M. and Jacquelyn Schachter, eds. 1989.

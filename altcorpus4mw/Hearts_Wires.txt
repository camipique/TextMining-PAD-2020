Hearts/Wires &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Hearts/Wires'''" is a single by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on April 4, 2016 as the third single from their eighth studio album, ''Gore''. "Hearts/Wires" came as a free download audio file for each physical copy of ''Gore'' purchased from the band's official web store. &&&&& &&&&& No official music video exists for the song. However, the band approved of an unofficial music video, which they shared to their official Facebook page. &&&&& &&&&& Stephen Carpenter told Rolling Stone that he was initially taken aback by "Hearts/Wires" because it evoked images of murder, rape, insanity and the serial killer from The Silence of the Lambs. "That song made me think of Wild Bill the whole time â€“ psycho killer and shit. I just didn't feel it," Carpenter said. "I had to embrace my inner psycho rapist and come up with the part and get into it." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Full lyrics of this song at MetroLyrics &&&&& * Deftones - Hearts/Wires (Unofficial Video) at YouTube &&&&& * Deftones - Hearts/Wires (Unofficial Video) at Vimeo &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

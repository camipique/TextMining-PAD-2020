254	Filtration_(probability_theory)
Filtration (probability theory) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& In the theory of stochastic processes, a subdiscipline of probability theory, '''filtrations''' are used to model the information that is available at a given point and therefore play an important role in the formalization of random processes. &&&&& &&&&& Definition &&&&& Let be a probability space and let be an index set with a total order (often , , or a subset of ). &&&&& &&&&& For every let be a sub-''σ''-algebra of . Then &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& is called a filtration, if for all . So filtrations are families of ''σ''-algebras that are ordered non-decreasingly. If is a filtration, then  is called a '''filtered probability space'''. &&&&& &&&&& Example &&&&& Let be a stochastic process on the probability space . Then &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& is a ''σ''-algebra and  is a filtration. Here denotes the ''σ''-algebra generated by the random variables . &&&&& &&&&& really is a filtration, since by definition all are ''σ''-algebras and &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Types of filtrations &&&&& === Right-continuous filtration === &&&&& If is a filtration, then the corresponding '''right-continuous filtration''' is defined as &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& with &&&&& : &&&&& The filtration itself is called right-continuous iff . &&&&& &&&&& === Complete filtration === &&&&& Let &&&&& : &&&&& be the set of all sets that are contained within a -null set. &&&&& &&&&& A filtration is called a '''complete filtration''', if every contains . This is equivalent to being a complete measure space for every . &&&&& &&&&& === Augmented filtration === &&&&& A filtration is called an '''augmented filtration''' if it is complete and right continuous. For every filtration there exists a smallest augmented filtration  of . &&&&& &&&&& If a filtration is an augmented filtration, it is said to satisfy the '''usual hypotheses''' or the '''usual conditions''' &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Natural filtration &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

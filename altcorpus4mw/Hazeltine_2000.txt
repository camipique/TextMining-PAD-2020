Hazeltine 2000 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Hazeltine 2000''' was one of the earliest smart terminals, released by Hazeltine Corporation in 1971. The basic model displayed 64 characters, upper-case only, in a 74-by-27 grid. An optional upgrade added lower-case characters in an 80-by-25 grid. Basic operations like moving the cursor or clearing the screen were accomplished through control sequences in the serial data, setting the pattern for most smart terminals that followed. &&&&& &&&&& The basic system was reimplemented several times using newer electronics as they became available during the 1970s. The development team was unhappy with the support they received from the corporation, and the division was spun off to form Esprit Systems. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Joachim Martin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Joachim Martin''' (1842-1897) was a carpenter from the village of Les Crottes, in the French Alps, who left a secret diary underneath the floorboards of the Ch√¢teau de Picomtal. &&&&& &&&&& The diary is made up of 72 entries dated between 1880 and 1881. Varying between mundane observations and poignant personal opinions, the diary provides a frank look into the provincial lives of Martin and his neighbors. Among his revelations are the fact that another villager had committed infanticide multiple times and hidden the evidence under a stable. Martin refused to report the man, even when he tried to seduce Martin's wife, writing, "He's my old childhood friend. And his mother is my father's mistress." &&&&& &&&&& The floorboards were excavated in the early 2000s, but the existence of the diary was not widely known until the publication of a book called ''Joaquim's Floorboard'' by historian Jacques-Olivier Boudon. He noted that the diary consists of "the words of an ordinary working man, a man of the people ... saying things that are very personal, because he knows they will not ever be read except a long time in the future." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Lu Yong was called "the first person to purchase anticancer drugs" because he shared the purchase of the imitation "Gleevec" Indian anticancer drug channel for more than a thousand netizens. &&&&& &&&&& In 2002, he was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The doctor recommended that he take anti-cancer called "Gleevec" produced by Swiss Novartis. The price of the drug was as high as 23,500 yuan, and a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia needs to take one box per month. &&&&& &&&&& In June 2004, Lu Yong accidentally learned that the imitation "Gleevec" anticancer drug produced in India was of almost the same quality, but offered at a price of only 4,000 yuan for a box. The comparison of the two Gleevec comparison tests in India and Switzerland showed that the drug similarity was 99.9%. Later, Lu Yong helped thousands of patients to buy this drug. &&&&& &&&&& On July 21, 2014, the Qijiang City Procuratorate arrested Lu Yonggong to the Qijiang City Court on charges of “damaging credit card management” and “selling fake drugs”. &&&&& &&&&& On January 27, 2015, the Qijiang City Procuratorate requested the court to withdraw the lawsuit against Lu Yong, and the court made a ruling on the “withdrawal of the lawsuit” on the same day. &&&&& &&&&& After Lu Yong was arrested, more than 300 patients jointly called him to plead, and he hoped that the judiciary could find Lu Yong not guilty. &&&&& &&&&& On the afternoon of January 29, 2015, the Hunan Qijiang City Procuratorate made a final decision, arguing that Lu Yong's behavior did not constitute a crime, and decided not to sue, Lu Yong was released. &&&&& &&&&& After release, Lu Yong wants to set up a volunteer organization or charitable foundation to serve leukemia patients. "One can end the weakness of single-handedness, and secondly, it can better serve more professionally and professionally." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

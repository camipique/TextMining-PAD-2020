Louisville–West Virginia football rivalry &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Louisville–West Virginia football rivalry''' is a college football rivalry game between the Cardinals of the University of Louisville and the Mountaineers of West Virginia University. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Louisville and West Virginia first met on the football field on September 8, 1984. The Mountaineers won the game by a score of 30–6. The teams met again the following year, with West Virginia prevailing by a score of 52–13 that remains to date as the largest margin of victory in the series. The Cardinals and Mountaineers met four more times between 1986 and 1993, with Louisville notching their first win over the Mountaineers in 1990 by a score of 9–7. The teams didn't meet again until Louisville joined the Big East for the start of the 2005 season. That year, the teams played in one of the most memorable games between the two. West Virginia overcame a 24–7 fourth quarter deficit and defeated Louisville 46–44 in triple overtime. The next year proved to be another classic, as #5 Louisville avenged its tough loss from 2005 with a 44–34 victory over #3 West Virginia on November 2, 2006. The following year, on November 8, 2007, the squads slugged it out in another close contest, with the Mountaineers emerging victorious by a margin of 38–31. The teams played every year until 2011, when West Virginia departed the Big East for the Big 12 Conference. Since the teams split into new conferences (Louisville joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2014), the future of the rivalry is in question and there are no current plans for the two teams to get together. Louisville won the most recent game, defeating #24 West Virginia by a score of 38–35 on November 5, 2011. &&&&& &&&&& Game results &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& == See also == &&&&& * List of NCAA college football rivalry games &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

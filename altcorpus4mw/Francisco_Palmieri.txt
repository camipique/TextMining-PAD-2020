Francisco Palmieri &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Francisco Luis “Paco” Palmieri''' served as the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, from January 2017 to November 2017, succeeding Mari Carmen Aponte. At present, he holds the title of Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs. In July 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Palmieri to be the next Ambassador of the United States to Honduras. This nomination was reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (SCFR) in September 2018, but was returned to the President at the close of the 115th Congress without consideration by the full Senate. In February 2019 it was reported that the Trump administration would discontinue its efforts to appoint Palmieri as ambassador to Honduras, in the face of opposition from Senator Marco Rubio, a proponent of a more hard-line approach to U.S. policy in Latin America. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Nomination Hearings &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

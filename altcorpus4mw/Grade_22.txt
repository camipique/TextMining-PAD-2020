Grade 22 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Grade 22''' (also referred to as '''BPS-22 grade''') is the highest attainable rank and pay scale for a civil servant in Pakistan. Grade 22 is equal to a three-star rank of the Pakistan Armed Forces. With over five thousand civil servants and bureaucrats in Pakistan, only a few dozen officers serve in BPS-22 grade at a given time. Hence, not even 1% of the country's civil servants make it to the highest basic pay scale of grade 22. Officers serving in BPS-22 grade are largely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the country. &&&&& &&&&& The most influential Grade 22 officials belong to the Pakistan Administrative Service and serve as federal secretaries and provinical chief secretaries &&&&& &&&&& Each officer who reaches grade 22 has, on average, a civil service career spanning over 30 years to 32 years.

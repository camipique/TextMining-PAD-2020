East Turkistan National Awakening Movement &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''East Turkistan National Awakening Movement ETNAM''' (Uyghur: شەرقىي تۈركىستان مىللىي ئويغۇنۇش ھەرىكىتى) is a Washington D.C. based human rights and political rights' group which declared its existence in June 2017. The group defines itself as a part and subset of the broad National Movement of East Turkistan as a nonviolent international political and human rights organization that seeks to restore the independence of East Turkistan in order to safeguard the freedoms and human rights of East Turkistan’s people. Salih Hudayar, a Uyghur American consultant and graduate student founded the group after pre-existing Uyghur/East Turkistan organizations failed to effectively call for East Turkistan's independence deeming it "controversial". &&&&& &&&&& Advocacy &&&&& &&&&& ETNAM seeks to establish unity, democratic values and compassion amongst the people of East Turkistan in order to restore the state of East Turkistan in accordance with international laws. It strives to promote the national interest and rights of all the peoples of East Turkistan within East Turkistan and internationally. &&&&& &&&&& ETNAM strongly believes that the East Turkistan National Movement is not exclusive to the Uyghurs but all Turkic peoples of East Turkistan including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, and others. The group advocates for the end of China's colonization and occupation of East Turkistan and actively strives to restore the independence of East Turkistan. ETNAM is the first Uyghur organization to not portray the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan as a persecuted minority, but rather as an occupied state. &&&&& &&&&& Activities &&&&& Since its founding, ETNAM has organized numerous demonstrations calling for the independence of East Turkistan and lobbied members of the US Congress to enact bills to help protect the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan. On December 20, 2018, in remembrance of the 69th anniversary of East Turkistan's occupation by the People's Republic of China, the group organized a march from the White House to the State Department and called on the US government to "recognize the genocide occurring in East Turkistan" and also called on the United Nations to "act according to the UN Genocide Convention and stop the 21st century Holocaust". &&&&& &&&&& The group has also sent a petition titled 'Condemn China's Concentration Camps and Prevent a 21st Century Holocaust in East Turkistan' to the White House calling on the US government to condemn China's mass incarceration of more than 3 million Uyghur and other Turkic peoples in concentration camps, and asking for the United States to recognize East Turkistan as an occupied territory. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * First East Turkestan Republic &&&&& * Second East Turkestan Republic &&&&& * East Turkestan Independence Movement &&&&& * Uyghur nationalism &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& __INDEX__ &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * ETNAM &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

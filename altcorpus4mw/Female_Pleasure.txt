Female Pleasure &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''#Female Pleasure''''' is a 2018 Swiss-German documentary film directed by Swiss director Barbara Miller. The film explores female sexuality in the 21st century around the globe. &&&&& &&&&& Content &&&&& The film argues for the liberation of female sexuality in equal, sensual relationships between the sexes in the 21st century. It accompanies five women from different cultural backgrounds who stand up against the repression of female sexuality in their cultural and religious communities. The film reveals similarities among the different protagonists and shows their struggle for self-determined sexuality, even if the backgrounds of the five activists are divers: the US-American author Deborah Feldman left the New York City Hasidic community; the Somali psychotherapist Leyla Hussein had to undergo genital mutilation as a child and fights against this practice; Japanese manga artist Rokudenashiko was arrested several times because of her work featuring female genitalia; Bavarian scholar Doris Wagner, a former nun, reported publicly on the experiences of abuse in a spiritual community in Rome; and Vithika Yadav, who works as a sex education publisher in Delhi. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& The film premiered on August 5, 2018 at the International Film Festival Locarno in the Semaine de la Critique. The film's release was on November 8, 2018 in Germany and Austria, and November 15 in Switzerland. In April 2019, the North American premiere follows at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& The production of the film was led by Mons Veneris Films GmbH, Zurich, Das Kollektiv für audiovisuelle Werke GmbH, Zurich, and Indi Film GmbH, Stuttgart, in a co-production with SRG SSR, Arte, SRF, RTS and RSI. The film was directed by Barbara Miller. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& === Box office=== &&&&& In Switzerland, the film had the biggest box office of all Swiss documentaries of the year 2018. In Germany, #Female Pleasure opened as the most successful film of the weekend and it was in the Top 4 of 2018. According to the German Television, the film was one of the most relevant documentaries of the year 2018. &&&&& &&&&& ===Critical response=== &&&&& As #Female Pleasure focuses on patriarchal constraints on women’s sexuality, film critics located the film as a contribution to the #MeToo debate. Martin Kudlac wrote on Screen Anarchy: "At the beginning of 21st century, gender and cultural stereotypes undergo major reassessment while women and their voices in the society are being empowered and heart loud and clear. (…) Miller adds her contribution to the hottest debate through the eyes of five brave women willing to act and testify." He continued that Miller did not attack religions though the film made "an informed point on inherent sexism and misogyny frequently exerted on behalf or under the pretense of a higher being while using women body as a key." &&&&& &&&&& Annette Scharnberg from Swiss Radio and Television underlined the importance of the film for mutual understanding between the sexes: "One can only hope that those individuals who are upset over the supposed whining about equality, MeToo and gender issues will be better able to comprehend, thanks to films like #Female Pleasure, why there is no other alternative than to fight back against this culture of oppression." She said that Miller demonstrated how discrimination, misogyny and sexualized violence were connected around the world to patriarchal structures, legitimized by sacred texts, whether those of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists or Hindus. &&&&& &&&&& Similar Muriel Del Don on cineuropa.org: "What this documentary seems to want to tell us is that it’s never too late to assert our right to exist. Women can and must assert their sexuality, not for the sake of duty, but in the name of pleasure, because this sexuality fast becomes a weapon with which to fight a patriarchy-prison of grotesque proportions." &&&&& &&&&& Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Maria Garcia estimated the objectivity and universality of the topic: Each of the protagonists "provides an insider view of the unique brand of misogyny that informs their respective cultures. All are survivors of rape or other forms of sexual assault. The issues they confront are not new, yet the stories of their radicalization are engaging, and Miller’s deft editing and objective approach result in a surprisingly intimate and life-affirming film." &&&&& &&&&& ===Accolades=== &&&&& The film has received several awards and nominations: After the Zonta Prize at the Critics Week at the Locarno Festival 2018, the film won the Special Prize of the Interreligious Jury at the International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film. For the Swiss Film Award 2019, #Female Pleasure was nominated in the three categories Best Documentary Film, Best Film Score, Best Film Editing, in Austria it won a Romy Award in the category Best Cinema Documentary. At the Thessaloniki Documentary Film Festival 2019 the film won the Amnesty International Award in the Human Right Section and the WIFT AWARD. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

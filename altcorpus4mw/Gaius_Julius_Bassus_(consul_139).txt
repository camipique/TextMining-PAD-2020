Gaius Julius Bassus (consul 139) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Gaius Julius Bassus''' was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Antoninus Pius. He was suffect consul in the ''nundinium'' of November-December 139 as the colleague of Marcus Ceccius Justinus. He was the son of Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, consul in 105. The Julii Bassi were a prominent family of Pergamum, that had descended from the Attalid dynasty and Galatian tetrarchs. &&&&& &&&&& Julius Bassus may be identical with one Bassus who was active in the second century; Lucan describes him as an effeminate sophist; the ''Palatine Anthology'' preserves a poem by one "Bassus of Smyrna", who need not have been born in that city; Galen dedicated his ''De libris propriis'' to one Bassus. &&&&& &&&&& Knowledge of the career of Julius Bassus is limited to one appointment, as governor of the imperial province of Dacia Superior; Werner Eck dates his tenure from late 135 (an inscription attests to his governorship on 13 December 135) to 138. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Alsina claimed that Borràs does tabloid journalism, while Borràs showed photographs of Alsina participating in events with people aligned with the far-right. Alsina's political past was also explained, talking about his membership to different far-right political parties. Nihil Obstat Holocaust denial was also discussed. Alsina defends that the magazine recognises it existed, but that it has been mystified because it has not been a unique event. Alsina stated that in history have existed many genocides. He also said that Hitler had the intention of creating a Jew State in Madagascar, that nazism did not think at first to commit extermination, but total migration (Madagascar Plan), extermination was not a must. During the debate Alsina denied that Juan Antonio Llopart, administrator of the publisher of Nihil Obstat, had been guilty of making Holocaust apology. Alsina alleged that after Llopart's condemn to two and half years by the Barcelona Court, he was absolved by the Supreme court of Spain.

He describes the concept of hispanist as the person who believes in a Spain formed by a single political entity, which opposes the multiple nationalities and political entities of Spain developed through the centuries in the Iberian Peninsula: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& He also defends the theory of indoctrination into Catalan nationalism through the Catalan education system ("''adoctrinamiento''" in Castilian Spanish), theory supported by right-wing parties and associations of Spain.

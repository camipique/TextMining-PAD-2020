The second narrative is set in Harlem, and follows the misadventures of a young translator who creates a deception while purporting to translate lost poems by the obscure, early 20th-century Mexican poet Gilberto Owen. The third narrative follows Gilberto Owen and his friend Federico García Lorca living in Philadelphia and New York City in the 1930s. &&&&& &&&&& The book has received acclaim for its unique reorientation of the invented spaces of language and identity.

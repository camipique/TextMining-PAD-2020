Human Dignity Alliance &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Human Dignity Alliance''' () is a minor political party in Ireland. It was officially founded on 29 June 2018 by Senator R칩n치n Mullen. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& R칩n치n Mullen, the party's founder, has served as an independent senator for the National University of Ireland constituency since 2007. In 2014 he contested the European Parliament election unsuccessfully in the Midlands-North-West constituency. Mullen was prominent in campaigns opposing same-sex marriage in 2015 and abortion in 2018 respectively. He is a member of the European Christian Political Movement. &&&&& &&&&& Foundation &&&&& The Human Dignity Alliance was borne out of a political grouping within Leinster House that met annually. The party is registered to contest European and Oireachtas elections. Mullen predicted the party would be a "slow burner" and see growth over time. Independent TD Mattie McGrath ruled out joining the Human Dignity Alliance, instead opting for forming his own party alongside fellow independent TD Michael Collins. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

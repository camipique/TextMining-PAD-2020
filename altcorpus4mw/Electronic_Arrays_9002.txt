Electronic Arrays 9002 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Electronic Arrays 9002''' (EA9002) was a microprocessor released in 1976. &&&&& &&&&& It was an 8-bit NMOS CPU, with an instruction set influenced by the Intel 4004.. It had a 4096 byte address space, due to its use of 12-bit addressing. &&&&& &&&&& It was reported to have a 2 microsecond instruction fetch and execution time, although another source says 3.2 microseconds for single byte instructions and 6.4 microseconds for two byte instructions. &&&&& &&&&& The EA9002 was largely unsuccessful. Its manufacturer, Electronic Arrays, struggled financially and with process issues. By November 1977, Electronic Arrays had ceased active marketing of the EA9002, and in 1978 it was acquired by NEC. &&&&& &&&&& Electronic Arrays supplied macro assemblers for the EA9002 for IBM 360 and National CSS mainframe systems. ASM/GEN and SIM/GEN, systems for developing for cross-assemblers and simulators in FORTRAN IV, supported the EA9002 as a target. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ferguson Fire &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Ferguson Fire''' was a wildfire in the Sierra National Forest, Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park in California in the United States. The fire was reported on July 13, 2018, burning , before it was 100% contained on August 19, 2018. Interior areas of the fire continued to smolder and burn until September 19, 2018, when InciWeb declared the fire to be inactive. The Ferguson Fire was caused by the superheated fragments of a faulty vehicle catalytic converter igniting vegetation. The fire, which burned mostly in inaccessible wildland areas of the national forest, has impacted recreational activities in the area, including in Yosemite National Park, where Yosemite Valley and Wawona were closed. The Ferguson fire caused at least $171.2 million (2018 USD) in damages, with a suppression cost of $118.5 million and economic losses measuring $52.7 million. Two firefighters were killed and nineteen others were injured in the fire. &&&&& &&&&& Timeline &&&&& &&&&& ===July=== &&&&& The Ferguson Fire was first reported on July 13, 2018, around 8:30 PM PDT in the Savage Trading Post area, in the Sierra National Forest in California.

Burning in an inaccessible area that is extremely steep and hazardous, the fire grew to by the morning of July 15. Crews focused on securing a fire line and protecting structures along Highway 140 and in Hite's Cove and Cedar Lodge. The first evacuations were put in place for communities of Jerseydale, Mariposa Pines and Yosemite West. By the evening, 108 structures were reported threatened, the fire was two percent contained and had grown . Two more communities were put on evacuation, as well as additional road closures along Highway 140 and select roads in the forest. &&&&& &&&&& By the morning of July 16, the fire had grown to , with most of the fire growth being in the Nutmeg and Devils Gulch areas.

By the morning of July 17, the western entrance to Yosemite National Park was closed. Power was restored for a portion of fire impacted areas near the National Park. &&&&& &&&&& Low-level smoke hampered visibility on July 18, grounding aircraft fighting the fire while the fire grew southeasterly. Crews continued to build handlines off the southeast portion of the Merced River to protect Yosemite West and crews completed firelines west of Indian Flat to west of Cedar Lodge. The next day, the fire moved towards Highway 140, Sweetwater Creek, Jerseydale, and Ferguson Ridge. Crews focused on improving indirect lines along Sweetwater Ridge and from Highway 140 southeast to Wawona Road. The fire continued to remain on the south side of the Merced River and mandatory evacuations were put in place for El Portal Trailer Court. &&&&& &&&&& On July 20, the fire jumped the Merced River, creating two spot fires north of the river in the Stanislaus National Forest near Miller Gulch and Ned Gulch.

Crews were called away from fighting a portion of the fire in the Stanislaus National Forest due to safety hazards. The fire continued to grow by the end of the day on July 22 and Old Yosemite Road was placed under mandatory evacuation and closed. &&&&& &&&&& The next morning, the fire was and was reported a thirteen percent contained with one structure being destroyed. Crews used hand and heavy equipment to build lines in Montgomery Gulch and areas of Eagle Peak and Buena Vista in the north, while the fire continued to burn in the Chowchilla Mountains in the south. Crews had success at protecting Jerseydale and mopping up began in that area. The fire was reported as being an estimated two miles from Yosemite National Park's boundary. &&&&& &&&&& On July 24, portions of Yosemite National Park were declared to close by noon on July 25, specifically Yosemite Valley and Wawona. Park visitors and residents in the closed areas are being asked to leave and evacuated. Mariposa Grove has been closed. In the evening, evacuation orders for Mariposa Pines were lifted. Firefighters had a productive day, with indirect containment lines being completed up Soapstone Ridge in the Stanislaus National Forest. Containment lines were also finalized from Jerseydale to Wawona Campground. &&&&& &&&&& Lushmeadows Estate was put under mandatory evacuation on July 25. Additional road closures were put in place in Wawona and Yosemite Falls. Warm and dry weather during the afternoon caused the fire to grow . Small gusts of wind in the early morning caused small spot fires. &&&&& Hotshot was one of many firefighters brought in to fight the Ferguson Fire &&&&& In the early evening, evacuations were lifted for Jerseydale and Sweetwater Ridge Road. Overnight, crews had worked to strengthen containment lines, especially near Magoon Creek, where crews focused on isolating the spread of a fire that had went over the containment line. A containment line was finished from Five Corners to Pilot Peak on the northside of the fire, as well as another finished around Wanona and the lines around El Porto were expanded. In the evening, on July 26, additional vegetation was burned from containment lines to further protect El Portal and Yosemite West. A three-acre spot fire crossed the containment line near Jerseysdale and was quickly suppressed. &&&&& &&&&& On Friday, July 27, Yosemite National Park announced that Yosemite Valley would reopen on August 3, with Wawona Road and Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias remaining closed. That evening, almost 4,000 personnel continued to fight the fire, with containment growing to 29 percent due to favorable conditions. Hot spots were extinguished on the west side of the fire and on the east side, crews completed firing operations from Henness Ridge to the Merced River. Aircraft burned pockets of vegetation between containment lines and the fire's perimeter. Additionally, crews strengthened and linked containment lines between burn scars from the 2017 Empire and South Fork Fires. On the south side, additional containment line strengthening took place. That night, evacuation orders for the Lushmeadows subdivision were lifted. A small fire, the result of swirling winds, jumped the containment line about two miles southwest of El Portal along the fire's northeast perimeter. Overnight, fire crews focused on strengthening and extending containment lines. Crews worked the area from Henness Ridge southeast to Highway 41 to prepare it for a new containment line. On the northern area of the fire, crews strengthened the containment line to reduce fuel availability. &&&&& &&&&& On July 29, a second firefighter was killed when he was struck by a tree. &&&&& The repopulation of Monte Vista and Vista Lago began when evacuation orders were lifted in the afternoon. Crews focused on mopping up hot spots and containing a small fire that started over the containment line near Eagle Peak. Overnight, crews put out two spot fires around Roundtree Saddle and began tactical firing towards Chowchilla Mountain and Wawona Campground. Crews continued efforts to protect giant sequoias in the fire area and also focused on securing the southeast quadrant of the fire to stop it from spreading into Yosemite National Park. Specialists began evaluating the western side of the fire for repair and mitigation as a result of suppression efforts. Evacuation orders were lifted for the East Westfall Road area and the Highway 140 and Ponderosa Basin. Overnight, the fire's perimeter grew to within one mile of Wawona Campground. Containment lines around the southwest corner of Yosemite National Park total six miles. Crews continue to focus on containing a portion of the fire that went over the containment line near El Portal. The fire is in an area with excessive amounts of beetle-killed trees and is very hard to access. Fire retardant and water drops were used in the meantime while ground crews explore other options for containment. Smoke visibility increased due to tactical firing. &&&&& &&&&& On the morning of July 31, Yosemite National Park stated that they would reopen the Yosemite Valley, Wawona Campground and sequoia groves on Sunday, August 5. Indirect fire lines were used to intercept the spot fire near El Portal and fire crews were sent to Foresta in case the fire moved northeastern.

Lithuanian Air Force Band &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Lithuanian Air Force Band''' () is a Lithuanian musical group representing the Lithuanian Air Force which participates in military parades and celebrations, funeral and reburial ceremonies, as well as concerts for the public. It was founded in Vilnius on 12 May 1994 as two separate orchestras (the central air force orchestra led by Colonel Č. Braziulis, and the Vytautas Magnus Battalion wind orchestra led by Colonel J. Veselkos). On 21 March 2001, the Commander of the Air Force and the Minister of National Defense ordered the merger of the two orchestras to become the representative air force orchestra. The orchestra has 29 musicians and is led by Captain Ričardas Kukulskis and Captain Remigijus Terminas. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * Lithuanian Armed Forces Orchestra &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * A concert of the orchestra &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

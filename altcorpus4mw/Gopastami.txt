Those days children were given the charge to take care of the calves. Both Krishna and Balarama having passed their fifth year, cowherd men conferred and agreed to give those boys who had passed their fifth year charge of the cows in the pasturing ground. Nanda Maharaj decided to organise a ceremony for Krishna and Balarama while going for cow grazing for the first time in Vrindavan. Raddha, a Hindu goddess, wanted to graze cows but was denied of being a girl. So, she disguised herself in a boy because of her resemblance to Subala-sakha, She put on his dhoti and garments and joined Krishna for cow herding along with her companions for funs. The festival is celebrated on the eighth day in the bright half of Karthik month. &&&&& &&&&& Celebrations &&&&& Go-puja is done on this day.

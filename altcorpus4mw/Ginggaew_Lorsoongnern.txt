Ginggaew Lorsoongnern &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Ginggaew Lorsoongnern''' (; ) was a Thai woman executed in 1979 for conspiring in a kidnapping and murder plot. She was executed, being the second woman in Thai history to be executed by gunfire. &&&&& &&&&& She had been fired from her housekeeping and childcare job by Vichai and Jitra Srijareonsukying, a Bangkok couple with a six-year-old son. Ginggaew needed money, so her 28-year-old boyfriend, who already had a criminal record, suggested holding the boy ransom. A total of six conspirators were identified by Thai authorities: aside from Ginggaew herself they were Thongmuan Grogkoggraud, Pin Peungyard, Thongsuk Puvised (the spouse of Pin), Gasem Singhara, and Suthi Sridee. &&&&& &&&&& Circa 18 October 1978 Ginggaew picked up the boy from school and took him to their hideout in Nakhon Ratchasima Province in Isan. The group demanded 200,000 baht from the family; they were to see a flag while en route between the Jantuek and Pakchong railway stations and deposit a bag holding the funds there, but the night was dark and the parents failed to see the flag. The kidnappers stabbed the boy, then buried him alive; they buried the boy with Thai burial ritual goods so they would not be haunted by his spirit. According to authorities, Ginggaew attempted to stop the murder but could not do so. Prison employee Chavoret Jaruboon stated that there were multiple lurid newspaper accounts of dubious veracity published around the time of the murder. In his memoir Chavoret stated "She was all over the news, like some kind of film star." &&&&& &&&&& Ginggaew was sentenced to death by firing squad on 12 January 1979 by the Prime Minister of Thailand. She was initially incarcerated at Lard Yao Prison at Klong Prem Central Prison, but was delivered to Bang Kwang Central Prison in Nonthaburi Province on 13 January 1979 for execution. Ginggaew's heart was on a different side than in most human bodies, so she survived the initial execution rounds. Authorities initially believed she was dead, but they discovered her in the morgue attempting to stand up after hearing her scream. She died after a second round of gunfire. &&&&& &&&&& Gasem and Pin also received death sentences, while a life sentence was given to Thongmuan, and Suthi and Thongsuk had 20 year sentences each. Gasem was executed at Bang Kwang the same day that Ginggaew was. Pin also died after two rounds of bullets. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

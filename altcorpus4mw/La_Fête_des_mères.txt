For the scenes shot at the Élysée Palace, President Emmanuel Macron and Élysée officials agreed to lend the hallway and the courtyard. President François Hollande had allowed director Mention-Schaar to visit his private apartments before he left office. Having realized these were Haussmann-style apartments, Mention-Schaar found smaller similar apartments for the shooting. The desk was recreated in a Paris ''hôtel particulier'' with a decorum similar to Élysée's. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * '' La Fêtes des mères'', UniFrance &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

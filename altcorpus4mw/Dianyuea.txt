125	Dianyuea
Dianyuea &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Dianyuea turbinata''''' is a species of shrub endemic to the Tongbiguan Nature Preserve in Yunnan province of China. Originally described in the genus ''Flacourtia'' (''F. turbinata'') based on limited material (no male individuals), this unusual species is now recognized as the sole member of the genus '''''Dianyuea''''' and is the only other member of subfamily Scyphostegioideae of Salicaceae. In addition to phylogenetic analyses of DNA data, the species's basal placentation, connate stamen filaments, and seeds with arilloid appendages indicate that this species is related to ''Scyphostegia'', a monotypic genus which is now placed in a broadly circumscribed Salicaceae. &&&&& &&&&& The genus is named after Dian-Yue (Chinese: 滇越), an ancient kingdom on the Southern Silk Road, where the genus/species is found. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

277	HD_34989
HD 34989 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&&  &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''HD 34989''' is a blue-white star in the main sequence, of apparent magnitude 5.78, in the constellation of Orion. It is 736 light-years from the solar system. &&&&& &&&&& Observation &&&&& In this visible-light image of the λ Orionis ring (Sh2-264), HD 34989 is visible near the right-hand border, above the brilliant star Bellatrix (β Orionis). &&&&& Infrared wavelengths are mapped to visible light in this image and show vdB 38 as a fluorescent green-blue glow surrounding HD 34989. &&&&& The star is in the northern celestial hemisphere, but close to the celestial equator; this means that it can be observed from all the inhabited regions of the Earth without difficulty and that it is not visible only in the innermost areas of Antarctica. It appears as circumpolar only far beyond the Arctic polar circle. Its brightness puts it at the limit of visibility to the naked eye, so to be observed without the aid of devices requires a clear, and preferably moonless, sky. &&&&& &&&&& The best period for observation in the evening sky is between late October and April from both hemispheres; in February (as at J2000) it is anti-posed from the sun. In July and August its direction is close to that of the sun, therefore coinciding with most hours of daylight. &&&&& &&&&& Physical characteristics &&&&& It is a blue-white star of the main sequence, having an absolute magnitude of -0.99 and its positive radial velocity indicates that the star is moving away from the solar system. The star appears wrapped in an extensive nebulosity that partly shines by reflection and partly by emission; this cloud is listed as vdB 38. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

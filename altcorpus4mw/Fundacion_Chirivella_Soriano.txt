The building was the residence of Joan de Valeriola, descendant of Arnau Valleriola, the most important financier in 14th century Valencia. The last member of the family that occupied the palace was Gaspar, who joined the Borja family after marrying Anna de Borja, niece of Pope Alexander VI. Its patrimonial and architectural value is based on its interior spaces, its unique Gothic elements (arches, windows, chairs) and the uniqueness of its wooden ceilings covered with great decorative details that were rediscovered during the rehabilitation of the building. &&&&& &&&&& == References == &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Fundacion Chirivella Soriano &&&&& * Sala d'Arcs.

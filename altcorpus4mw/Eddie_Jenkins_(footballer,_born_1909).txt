Eddie Jenkins (footballer, born 1909) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Edwin Jonathan Jenkins''' (16 July 1909 – 5 August 2005) was a Welsh professional footballer. He began his professional career with Cardiff City, making his debut for the club in February 1930. After two seasons as a reserve, he featured regularly for the club in the Third Division South between 1932 and 1934, making 87 appearances in all competitions before being released. He later played for Bristol City and Newport County before retiring. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Born in Cardiff, Jenkins worked as a milkman while playing local amateur football for Cardiff East when he was spotted by coaches at Cardiff City. He joined the club in 1930, making his professional debut on 4 February 1930 in a 2–1 defeat to Bradford City in the Second Division. He made seven further league appearances for the club at the end of the 1930–31 season in place of club captain Fred Keenor, who would leave the club soon after to join Crewe Alexandra, as Cardiff suffered relegation to the Third Division South. After a second season as a reserve player, making just five appearances, he eventually established himself in the first team at the start of the 1932–33 season after displacing William Roberts. &&&&& &&&&& The club struggled in the Third Division South, finishing 19th in 1933 followed by a bottom-placed finish in 1934, and Jenkins was one of several players released by new manager Ben Watts-Jones in an attempt to reverse the club's fortunes. Following his release, Jenkins was offered a contract with Tottenham Hotspur but rejected the move as he felt "there were better prospects in the milk business." However, Jenkins returned to professional football the following season, joining Bristol City where he spent one season. He later moved to Newport County where he finished his professional career. &&&&& &&&&& Later life &&&&& Following the outbreak of World War II, Jenkins served in the Far East and North Africa, where he was awarded the Africa Star. On his return to Britain after the war, he joined his father's milk company and became a Freemason. He later wrote a book on Splott in Cardiff, the area of the city that he grew up, entitled ''The Splott I Remember''. He died on 5 August 2005 at the age of 96 in Cardiff. At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving former Cardiff City player. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

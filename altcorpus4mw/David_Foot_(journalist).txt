David Foot (journalist) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''David Foot''' (born 1929) is an English journalist and historian. He has written extensively on cricket and the West Country. &&&&& &&&&& Foot was born in the Somerset village of East Coker and has spent most of his life in Somerset and Gloucestershire. He began his journalistic career with the ''Western Gazette'' in Yeovil, moving on to the ''Bristol Evening World'', but since 1962 he has worked largely as a freelance. &&&&& &&&&& Foot's book ''Beyond Bat & Ball'' won the Cricket Societyâ€™s Book of the Year award in 1993. Reviewing it in ''Wisden'', Geoffrey Moorhouse agreed with the opinion of Dennis Silk in the book's foreword that as a writer Foot "is as good as Robertson-Glasgow at his best". Silk also said: "If the cricket lover is not quite clear about why he loves the game, he will become much clearer after reading this book." &&&&& &&&&& The sport journalist Frank Keating called Foot's biographies of Harold Gimblett and Wally Hammond "imperishable classics in cricket's canon". &&&&& &&&&& Foot lives in Bristol with his wife Anne. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& * ''Ladies' Mile'' by Victoria Hughes (1977; edited) &&&&& * ''Gardening My Way'' by John Abrams (1978; edited) &&&&& * ''Famous Bristolians: And Others Having Strong Associations with the City'' (1979) &&&&& * ''Viv Richards'' by Viv Richards, with David Foot (1979, 1982) &&&&& * ''From Grace to Botham: Profiles of 100 West Country Cricketers'' (1980) &&&&& * ''Zed: Zaheer Abbas'' by Zaheer Abbas, with David Foot (1983) &&&&& * ''Harold Gimblett: Tormented Genius of Cricket'' (1984) &&&&& * ''Learn Cricket with Viv Richards: A Young Player's Guide'' by Viv Richards, with David Foot (1985) &&&&& * ''Cricket's Unholy Trinity'' (1985) &&&&& * ''Sunshine, Sixes and Cider: The History of Somerset Cricket'' (1986) &&&&& * ''Viv Richards'' (1987) &&&&& * ''Country Reporter'' (1990) &&&&& * ''40 Years On: The Story of the Lord's Taverners'' (1990) &&&&& * ''Strange Dorset Stories'' (1991) &&&&& * ''Somerset Cricket: A Post-War Who's Who'' (1993; with Ivan Ponting) &&&&& * ''Beyond Bat & Ball: Eleven Intimate Portraits'' (1993) &&&&& * ''Wally Hammond: The Reasons Why: A Biography'' (1996) &&&&& * ''Fragments of Idolatry: From "Crusoe" to Kid Berg: Twelve Character Studies'' (2001) &&&&& * ''Shep: My Autobiography'' by David Shepherd, with David Foot (2001) &&&&& * ''Sixty Summers: Somerset Cricket since the War'' (2006; with Ivan Ponting) &&&&& * ''Footsteps from East Coker'' (2010) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

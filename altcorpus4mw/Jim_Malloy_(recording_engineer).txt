Alan Emig, head of Columbia Records' West Coast division and a former mixing engineer for Capitol Records, tutored Malloy in engineering. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Gospel singer Mahalia Jackson was the first artist that Malloy was allowed to mix.

He worked with Atkins at RCA Victor from January 1965 to November 1968, then at Monument Records. In the early 1970s, Malloy produced Sammi Smith's Grammy-winning recording of "Help Me Make It Through the Night" and started his own company, called DebDave Music, named after his two children, Debra and David. &&&&& &&&&& Accolades &&&&& Aside from his Grammy win, Malloy was nominated for five more Grammys for his work on Elvis Presley's ''How Great Thou Art'', Eddy Arnold's ''The Last Word in Lonesome'', ''The Latin Sound of Henry Mancini'', ''The Pink Panther'' (1963) soundtrack, and "''The Addams Family'' Theme". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * Jim Malloy at grammy.com &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

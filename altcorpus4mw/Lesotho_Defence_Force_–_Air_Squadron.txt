Lesotho Defence Force – Air Squadron &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Lesotho Defence Force – Air Squadron''' is the air force of the Lesotho Defence Force &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Lesotho Defence Force Air Wing was an originally a 1978 offshoot of the paramilitary police mobile unit and began operations with two Short Skyvan twin turboprop STOL transports; a leased Cessna A152 Aerobat; two MBB Bo 105 helicopters; and a Bell 47G helicopter converted to turboshaft power. Two Mil Mi-2 twin turbine helicopters were donated by Libya in 1983 but were retired by 1986. &&&&& &&&&& Deliveries of four Bell 412 helicopters were delayed in 1983 to 1986 because of South Africa's influence. This changed when a 1986 military coup resulted in new security agreements with South Africa being signed. In the mid-1980s the air wing was mergerd into the Lesotho Defence Force. In 1989 the Skyvans were replaced by two CASA C-212 Aviocar light turboprop transports; one immediately crashed, requiring a third to be delivered in 1992. A fifth Bell 412 (an EP model) was delivered in May 1998 to replace one written off the previous January. &&&&& &&&&& Inventory &&&&& &&&&& === Current inventory === &&&&& An abandoned Casa C.212 of the LDF &&&&& The nose of a crashed LDF Casa C.212 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Aircraft &&&&& &&&&& Origin &&&&& &&&&& Type &&&&& &&&&& Variant &&&&& &&&&& In service &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Transport &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& CASA C-212 &&&&& &&&&& Spain &&&&& &&&&& utility / transport &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& GippsAero GA8 Airvan &&&&& &&&&& Australia &&&&& &&&&& utility / transport &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Helicopters &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bell 206 &&&&& &&&&& United States &&&&& &&&&& trainer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bell 412 &&&&& &&&&& United States &&&&& &&&&& utility &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& MBB Bo 105 &&&&& &&&&& Germany &&&&& &&&&& utility / scout &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Airbus Helicopters H125 &&&&& &&&&& EU &&&&& &&&&& utility / scout &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Retired aircraft: Dornier Do 27, Dornier Do 28, Eurocopter EC135, MBB/Kawasaki BK 117, Mil Mi-2, Short Skyvan &&&&& &&&&& Accidents and incidents &&&&& all of the accidents and incidents have occurred because of technical problems and inexperienced pilots. &&&&& &&&&& * On 13 April 2017, a Eurocopter EC135 T2+ crashed on 13 April 2017 in the area of Thaba Putsoa, killing all four people on board.

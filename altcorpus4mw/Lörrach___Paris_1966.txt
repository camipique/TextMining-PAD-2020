Lörrach / Paris 1966 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Lörrach / Paris 1966''''' is a live album by saxophonist and composer Albert Ayler, recorded in Europe in 1966 and first released on the Swiss hat MUSICS label in 1982. The album was rereleased on CD in 2002 with additional recordings from the Paris concert. &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek states: "The two concerts presented on this disc represent two of the finest dates of Albert Ayler's European tour of 1966. The band was in fantastic shape and performed beyond expectation on both evenings. What is most noticeable about these dates and how they fill in a part of the Ayler mystique as a performer was to hear how immediately he would dictate a marching rhythm, theme, or folk song melody, or even perhaps a child ballad ... This is an amazing document, like the Hilversum sessions but better, because the sound is respectable here and matches the grandeur and shocking emotional immediacy of the performances". &&&&& All About Jazz writer Glenn Astarita said: "Nearly five decades have passed, and Ayler's invigorating sound-designs and idiosyncratic technique remain fresh and somewhat unparalleled after all these years". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All compositions by Albert Ayler except as indicated &&&&& # "Bells" – 13:10 &&&&& # "Jesus" (Don Ayler) – 6:50 &&&&& # "Our Prayer" (Don Ayler) – 6:00 &&&&& # "Spirits" – 3:05 &&&&& # "Holy Ghost" – 11:00 &&&&& # "Ghost (1st Variation)" – 7:35 &&&&& # "Ghost" – 4:25 &&&&& # "Holy Family" – 10:40 &&&&& # "Spiritual Rebirth/Light in Darkness/Infinite Spirit" – 11:05 Additional track on CD reissue &&&&& # "All/Our Prayer/Holy Family" (Albert Ayler/Donald Ayler/Albert Ayler) – 4:45 Additional track on CD reissue &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Albert Ayler – tenor saxophone &&&&& *Don Ayler – trumpet &&&&& *Michel Sampson – violin &&&&& *William Folwell – bass &&&&& *Beaver Harris – drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Golf at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Qualification for Golf at the 2020 Summer Olympics''' in Tokyo is determined not by any form of qualifying tournament, but by the rankings maintained by the International Golf Federation. &&&&& &&&&& Qualification will be based on world ranking (Official World Golf Ranking for men, Women's World Golf Rankings for women) as of 22 June 2020 (men) or 29 June 2020 (women), with a total of 60 players qualifying in each of the men's and women's events. The top 15 players of each gender will qualify, with a limit of four golfers per country that can qualify this way. The remaining spots will go to the highest-ranked players from countries that do not already have two golfers qualified, with a limit of two per country. The IGF has guaranteed that at least one golfer from the host nation and each geographical region (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) will qualify. The IGF will post weekly lists of qualifiers based on current rankings for men and women. &&&&& &&&&& Qualified players &&&&& ===Men=== &&&&& &&&&& ===Women=== &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

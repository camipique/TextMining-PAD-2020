A Plantation of Ulster grant dated 1611 spells the name as ''Evelagh''. The 1641 Depositions spell the name as ''Leuella''. &&&&& &&&&& From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan. &&&&& &&&&& In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 16 August 1611, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, Evelagh to Thomas Jones-''Evelagh to Thomas Johnes, gentleman''. At Cavan, on 26 July 1642, the aforesaid Thomas Jones and his son William Jones gave the names of rebel leaders in the Cavan Irish Rebellion of 1641, including, inter alia, ''Laighlen mac Torlough McKernan of '''Leuella''', James mac Laighlen McKernan of same and Hugh mac Laighlen McKernan of same''.

Each was entitled to cast two votes. The four election candidates were Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont and Lord Newtownbutler (later Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough), both of whom were then elected Member of Parliament for Cavan County. The losing candidates were George Montgomery (MP) of Ballyconnell and Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham. Absence from the poll book either meant a resident did not vote or more likely was not a freeholder entitled to vote, which would mean most of the inhabitants of Evlagh Beg. &&&&& &&&&& The townland formed part of the Farnham estate in the 19th century. The estate papers are now in the National Library of Ireland and those papers mentioning Evlagh Beg are at reference 21. F. 118/40 and 21.

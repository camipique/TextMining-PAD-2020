827	Gosos
Gosos &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''''' or '''''' are a kind of devotional and paraliturgical songs of Iberian origin typical of Sardinia, and written in the Sardinian language. &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& The term and its varieties (, , and in Gallurese) used in the central-northern part of Sardinia derive from the Castilian , whereas in southern Sardinia the varieties , , and derive from the Catalan , which has been kept as such in the city of Alghero. Both and seem to originate in turn from the Latin meaning "joy" or "delight". Sergio Bullegas, to whom the seem to constitute "an hagiographic genre of dramatic kind", stresses the "clear influence of the Hispano-Catalan culture" and the "rather close linguistic relationship with the ." &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The ''goigs'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In the so-called Catalan Countries, the are popular compositions of poetry praising the Virgin Mary or the Saints. In Catalan, where the word has its origin, the plural and masculine form is always used even if it is about a single piece, in light of their goal to celebrate the Virgin's Seven Joys. The were sung during religious ceremonies, processions, pilgrimages and the votive festivals. &&&&& Fragment of a popular ''goig'' to the Holy Chalice sung in Valencia Cathedral &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& A minor denomination comes from the Catalan (strophe), called ''gròbbes'' or ''cròbbes'', which also comprise some other genres related to the improvised poetry in some areas around Nuoro, and especially where the conventional boundaries of the Logudorese and Campidanese dialects merge. &&&&& &&&&& The ''gosos'' in Sardinia &&&&& The include religious pieces of music in the Sardinian language and all its dialects, following a rhyme scheme based on the octave, sestina and quintain. &&&&& &&&&& According to the scholar , the roots of the Sardinian actually lie in the Byzantine models: they are in fact identical to the Greek kontakion in terms of the metre structure and the strophes with the chorus at the end. It is also known from the ''De cerimoniis aulae Byzantinae'' that the protospatharios Torchitorio I, in honor of the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, sent a delegation of Sardinians who sang a peculiar Greek hymn in Constantinople. Some other authors think that the derive from the Italian ''lauda'', which made its way to Sardinia and the other regions of Europe thanks to Saint Francis' spiritual influence; it has also been theorised that the style of singing might actually be of autochthonous origin, with sonorities typical of the ancient Mediterranean region. &&&&& &&&&& Starting from the 14th century, the were already mentioned as a fundamental part of the novenas; while Sardinian was still retained in the 15th century, the Spanish language overall prevailed. A temporary halt is attested when the Spanish Inquisition operated, but the genre of religious drama spread on the island in the 17th century, and the were an integral part of such rituals. &&&&& &&&&& Philip IV imposed a ban on theatrical performances in 1649; however, the tradition in Sardinia was kept alive and, from the 18th century onwards, manuscripts documenting the in Sardinian became widespread and were soon handed out to all the local communities. Some pieces written in Spanish have also been saved, such as the one in the parish of Sedilo by Jaime Zonquelo Espada, who composed the ''Gosos de la Virgen de la Piedad'' in 1734. &&&&& &&&&& They became the subject of censorship again in 1763, when the archbishop of Sassari Giulio Cesare Viancini forbade the in favour of a sterner style (the prelate had favourable views towards Jansenism). These popular Sardinian chants were forbidden once more in 1924, when the (Plenary Council of Sardinia) congregated at the Santa Giusta Cathedral in Oristano and put a ban on this kind of singing. The following years also saw the being declared illegal, in accordance with a series of policies that favoured cultural assimilation to Italian and discouraged the use of the non-Italian dialects and languages, Sardinian included. &&&&& &&&&& Collections &&&&& The most ancient text known is the collection of the ''Laudes a sa Rejna de sa Rosa''. Grazia Deledda has documented some in a chapter of her work ''Tradizioni popolari di Nuoro'' (), as they were reported to her in the prolific collector Giuseppe Ferraro's work ''Canti popolari in dialetto logudorese''. Said collection by Ferraro has 37 transcribed, some of them being reported in the single local varieties, and all of them reporting the name of whoever collected them first. &&&&& &&&&& In 2004, the diocese of Nuoro released a collection of edited by the priests Giovanni Carta and Pietro Muggianu, with one hundred or so that were scattered across the various parishes of central Sardinia. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Music of Sardinia &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * (translated into Italian by Raffa Garzia as ) &&&&& * Dore, Giovanni (1983).

106	Glufimet
Glufimet &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Glufimet''' (developmental code name '''RGPU-238'''), also known as '''dimethyl 3-phenylglutamate hydrochloride''', is a derivative of glutamic acid (glutamate) which was developed in Russia and is related to the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivative phenibut (3-phenyl-GABA). It contains phenibut and glycine fragments in its chemical structure, has been described as a "GABA precursor", and is said to modulate the GABA and nitric oxide (NO) systems and to have antioxidant activity. It has been suggested that metabotropic glutamate receptors may also play a role in the mechanism of action of glufimet. Stress-protective effects have been described for glufimet in animals. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

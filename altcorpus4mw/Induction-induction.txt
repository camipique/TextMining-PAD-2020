302	Induction-induction
Induction-induction &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In intuitionistic type theory (ITT), some discipline within mathematical logic, '''induction-induction''' is for simultaneously declaring some inductive type and some inductive predicate over this type. &&&&& &&&&& An inductive definition is given by rules for generating elements of some type. One can then define some predicate on that type by providing constructors for forming the elements of the predicate , such inductively on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-induction generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the predicate, because '''the rules for generating elements of the type''' '''are allowed to refer to the predicate''' . &&&&& &&&&& Induction-induction can be used to define larger types including various universe constructions in type theory. and limit constructions in category/topos theory &&&&& &&&&& Example 1 &&&&& &&&&& Present the type as having the following constructors , note the early reference to the predicate : &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& and-simultaneously present the predicate as having the following constructors : &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * if and then &&&&& * if and and then . &&&&& &&&&& As you can see, we gave rules for generating the elements of which amount to saying that is (isomorphic to) the booleans, and is (isomorphic to) the natural numbers. &&&&& &&&&& Example 2 &&&&& &&&&& A simple common example is the Universe à la Tarski type former. It creates some inductive type and some inductive predicate . For every type in the type theory (except itself!), there will be some element of which may be seen as some code for this corresponding type ; The predicate inductively encodes each possible type to the corresponding element of ; and constructing new codes in will require referring to the decoding-as-type of earlier codes , via the predicate . &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Induction-recursion – for simultaneously declaring some inductive type and some recursive function on this type . &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * A list of Peter Dybjer's publications on induction and induction-recursion &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

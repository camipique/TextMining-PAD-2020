Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England''' is an encyclopedia of English law edited by Alexander Wood Renton and (captain) Maxwell Alexander Robertson (sometimes called "Max Robertson"). The first edition was published as '''Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England, Being a New Abridgment''', in thirteen volumes (including a supplement edited by A W Donald), from 1897 to 1903. The second edition was published as '''Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England, with Forms and Precedents''', in seventeen volumes (including two supplementary volumes), from 1906 to 1919. Volumes one to five of the third edition, revised, edited by Ernest Arthur Jelf, were published from 1938 to 1940. &&&&& &&&&& The encyclopedia has a foreword by Frederick Pollock. &&&&& &&&&& Other contributors included Challis, Holland, Ilbert, Maitland, Blake Odgers, Phillimore, and "many other recognized authorities on the subjects with which they deal". "A high standard of execution is maintained throughout". Holland's account of the Civil Law has been called "admirable" and Ilbert's article on Codification has been called "brightly written" and said to do "full justice to Bentham's work as a law reformer". Jelf said the paper on "Customs", contributed to volume 4 by C J Follett was "excellent". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *Julius J Marke (ed), A Catalogue of the Law Collection at New York University with Selected Annotations, Law Center of New York University, 1953, Library of Congress Catalog card 58-6489, Reprinted by The Lawbook Exchange Ltd (Union, New Jersey) 1999, p 33 &&&&& *Percy Henry Winfield.

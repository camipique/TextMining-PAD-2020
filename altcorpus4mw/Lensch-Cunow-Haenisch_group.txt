Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group''' was a political faction within the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1915 by anti-revisionist marxists who despite previously opposing participation in the First World War now supported it. Its name comes from the three principal protagonists: Paul Lensch, Heinrich Cunow and Konrad Haenisch. They followed the initiative of Parvus in advocating a German victory as a positive step for international social democracy. They mobilised Marxist arguments behind the war effort. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Goniopora stokesi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Goniopora stokesi''''' is a species of colonial stony coral. As with other species in genus ''Goniopora'', it has the common names 'flowerpot coral' and 'daisy coral'. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorises its status as near threatened. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Goniopora stokesi'' is found widely across the northern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. In roughly clockwise order: from Madagascar and the Gulf of Aden in the west, through the Maldives and southern India, through the East Indies, up to Japan, and down to northern parts of Western Australia, and to the Great Barrier Reef in the east. It has been described as usually uncommon but conspicuous, but sometimes locally common. It has been reported at depths of , less commonly at . It is usually free-living; that is, not attached to a fixed substrate. Colonies are often found on sandy bottoms, in turbid and relatively still waters. They are usually hemispherical, and often have satellite (daughter) colonies which have not yet budded off. &&&&& &&&&& ''Goniopora stokesi'' has a reputation among aquarists both of being readily available commercially, and of being difficult to maintain in The aquarium trade may be one reason why the species is under threat. &&&&& &&&&& The specific epithet ''stokesi'' may be in honour of Charles Stokes ( - 1853), a respected English amateur malacologist. It would be necessary to consult the original paper describing the species (which does not seem to have been digitised) to settle the matter. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

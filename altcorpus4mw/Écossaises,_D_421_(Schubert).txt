144	Écossaises,_D_421_(Schubert)
Écossaises, D 421 (Schubert) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Franz Schubert's '''''Écossaises''''', D 421, are six short dances for solo piano: &&&&& # A major &&&&& # F minor (ends in A major) &&&&& # E major &&&&& # A major &&&&& # B major &&&&& # D major (ends in B minor) &&&&& &&&&& The pieces do not have tempo indications, and recordings have ranged from under 2 minutes to over 4 minutes in length for all six pieces. &&&&& &&&&& Schubert wrote these ''Écossaises'' in May 1816 during a visit to Josef von Spaun's new home in the Landstraße suburb south-east of Vienna. During the visit, Schubert was locked into his room for a prank, which was that he was to finish a composition before being released. He produced these six ''Écossaises'', and the following words were inscribed on the (now lost) title page: "Composed while confined to my room at Erdberg, May 1816." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

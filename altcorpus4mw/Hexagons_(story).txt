205	Hexagons_(story)
Hexagons (story) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''"Hexagons"''' is a 2003 alternate history short story by American writer Robert Reed. It was first published in the magazine '' Asimov's Science Fiction''. &&&&& &&&&& Synopsis &&&&& In 1933 in a world where the Roman Empire never fell, and India and China became the world's dominant technological powers, twelve-year-old Samuel Dunlop watches as his father tries to run for office. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& "Hexagons" was a finalist for the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Novelette. &&&&& &&&&& Io9 has noted that, unlike many stories in which the Roman Empire did not fall, "Hexagons" is not "explicitly dystopian". &&&&& &&&&& ''Tangent Online''s Chris Markwyn considered it to be a "compelling" story that is "well-told but fairly conventional", and observed that the contraband history-simulator owned by Samuel's friend's grandfather "undercut" the story's ability to "assert its own reality"; Markwyn further noted that Reed's choice of villain — a "blue-eyed, small-mustached, table-pounding ultra-nationalist who blames his country's problems on the Jews", who is "obviously an analogue of a historical figure" — results in an emphasis on the "artificial, game-like nature of Reed's scenario", ultimately detracting from readers' suspension of disbelief. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Text of the story &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

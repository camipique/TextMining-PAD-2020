Daniel Lee Corwin &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Daniel Lee Corwin''' (born September 13, 1958 in Orange County, California - December 7, 1998 in Huntsville, Texas) was an American serial killer who was sentenced to death and executed for murdering three women. &&&&& &&&&& Crimes &&&&& In 1975, Corwin abducted a classmate from high school. He drove her to a remote location in her own car and raped her. He then dragged her out of the car, knocked her down, stabbed her heart with a knife and left her for dead. However, she survived, and managed to reach the road where she was eventually seen and saved. Corwin was sentenced to forty years in prison for kidnapping, rape and attempted murder, but was released early after nine years. &&&&& &&&&& In February 1987, he abducted 72-year-old Alice Martin, who was walking to her home in Normangee, Texas. He drove her to a field in Robertson County where he raped, gagged and stabbed her. In July of the same year, he kidnapped 26-year-old Debra Lynn Ewing from her Huntsville workplace and drove her to Montgomery County, where he raped and stabbed her. In October 1987, he attempted to kidnap 36-year-old Mary Carrell Risinger at a car wash in Huntsville. However, she resisted and screamed for help, which resulted in Corwin stabbing her in front of her 3-year-old daughter. In October 1988, he abducted another woman in her own car, raping, beating and stabbing her several times. The woman, however, survived. &&&&& &&&&& Corwin was tracked down using fingerprints and DNA tracing. During his trial, he confessed to another rape, that of a 13-year-old girl that took place in 1972. The police were notified at the time, but the victim couldn't identify her attacker. &&&&& &&&&& In 1990, he was eventually sentenced to death by a Montgomery Court, and executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit on December 7, 1998. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

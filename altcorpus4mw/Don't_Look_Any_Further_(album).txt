Don't Look Any Further (album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Don't Look Any Further''''' is the first released solo album by American R&B singer Dennis Edwards, former The Temptations lead singer. The album was released in 1984 through Gordy Records. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Edwards first made a solo recording in 1977, but had nothing to show for it but an unreleased album. He returned for the sessions of The Temptation's album ''Back to Basics'', but then again left in the middle of the sessions. &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& The album reached No. 2 on the R&B charts. The album was launched with the hit single "Don't Look Any Further," a duet with Siedah Garrett. Though Edwards never had another big solo hit, “Don’t Look Any Further” created a its own legacy, partly due to Edwards’ and Garrett’s performances, and partly due to its iconic bassline. The bassline served as the bedrock for dozens of hip-hop, R&B, and pop tracks in the decades to follow. &&&&& &&&&& It also included the radio singles "(You're My) Aphrodisiac" and "Just Like You." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (1984) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US R&B Albums &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

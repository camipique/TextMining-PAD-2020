Journey to the Center of the Circle &&&&& Introduction &&&&& right &&&&& '''''Journey to the Center of the Circle''''' is a 1981 fantasy role-playing game adventure published by Wilmark Dynasty. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Journey to the Center of the Circle'' is an adventure in which a party is sent to a legendary shrine of Good in response to a request for help. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Lewis Pulsipher reviewed ''Journey to the Center of the Circle'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 49. Pulsipher commented that "With some ''tough'' editing, this module might have been worth publication in a magazine as an example of an unusual approach to FRP. But as a separate module it is as overpriced as ''Burgundy Pit'', and is otherwise not equal to the ''Pit'''s modest standard. Unless you're really sold on the idea of halls of testing, save your money." &&&&& &&&&& Reviews &&&&& * ''Different Worlds'' #21 (June, 1982) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Jonathan Flint (professor) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jonathan Flint''' is a British behavior geneticist and Professor in Residence in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He is also a senior scientist in the Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. He is known for his research on the genetics of complex traits in mice and major depressive disorder in humans. In 2015, he and his colleagues published a study that was the first to link two genetic variants to this disorder. He received The Genetics Society's Medal in 2014. In 2016, he left his post as Director of the Psychiatric Genetics Group at the University of Oxford's Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics to join UCLA. Upon doing so, he became one of four directors of UCLA's Depression Grand Challenge, which aims to conduct a study of 100,000 people to search for genetic risk factors for depression. This study is intended to be the largest genetic study of a disorder ever conducted in humans. &&&&& He is a member of the Editorial Board for ''Current Biology''. &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Faculty profile at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

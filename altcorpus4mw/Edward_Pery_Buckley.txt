Edward Pery Buckley &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Edward Pery Buckley''' (7 November 1796 – 28 May 1873) was a British Liberal and Whig politician. &&&&& &&&&& Buckley was the son of his namesake, Edward Pery Buckley, and Lady Georgiana West. He married Catherine Pleydell-Bouverie, daughter of William Pleydell-Bouverie and Catherine née Pelham-Clinton, in 1828, and together they had six children: Frances Gertrude (died 1921); Alfred (1829–1900); Edward William (1829–1840); Duncombe Frederick (1831–1855); Felix John (1834–1911); and Victor (1838–1882). &&&&& &&&&& He was first elected Whig MP for Salisbury at a by-election in 1853—caused by the death of Charles Baring Wall–and, becoming a Liberal in 1859, held the seat until the 1865 general election, when he did not seek re-election. &&&&& &&&&& Outside of his political career, Buckley also became Colonel in the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Establishment Division &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Establishment Division''' is the human resource arm of the Government of Pakistan. It deals with all matters related to the country's civil service and is regarded as one of the most sensitive and important divisions of the federal government. The division operates directly under the Prime Minister of Pakistan as the Minister In-charge. The Establishment Division, headed by the Federal Establishment Secretary, has a key role in recommending to the Prime Minister the right man for the right job in all government ministries, divisions and departments. According to the Civil Service Manual, the Establishment Secretary has the authority to single-handedly appoint or transfer officers up to Grade 20. A summary to the Prime Minister is sent only for grades 21 and 22. Since the Prime Minister is the competent authority, he sends back the summary to the Establishment Division, where the Establishment Secretary issues the notification. &&&&& &&&&& The Establishment Secretary reports directly to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The Establishment Secretary is assisted by two Additional Secretaries of grade 21. Under them are seven Joint Secretaries of grade 20, however the Joint Secretary of E-Wing is directly under the charge of the Establishment Secretary instead of the Additional Secretaries. The Joint Secretary of E-Wing is one of the most coveted slots of grade 20 in the federal government. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

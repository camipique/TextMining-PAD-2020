119	Helena_Czaplińska
Helena Czaplińska &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Helena Czaplińska &&&&& '''Helena Czaplińska''' (died 1651), was a Ukrainian Hetmana by marriage to Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Hetman of Zaporizhian Host (r. 1648-1657). She was an influential figure among the Ukrainian Cossacks and known as "Helen of the Steppe". Initially married to Daniel Czapliński, her influence was seen as a threat as she was suspected to betray her second husband the hetman in favor of her loyalties of her former marriage. She was famously executed for treason by her stepson Tymofiy Khmelnytsky during the absence of her spouse. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& * E. Latacz.

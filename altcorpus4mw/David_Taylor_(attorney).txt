David Taylor (attorney) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''David Taylor''' is an American attorney and the founder of Taylor Strategic PC, a risk and crisis management law firm. From 2016-18, Taylor was General Counsel and ultimately CEO of Theranos, a privately held health technology company known for its allegedly false claims to have devised revolutionary blood tests using very small amounts of blood. Taylor joined Theranos in May 2016 as Senior Litigation Counsel and became General Counsel in November 2016.  In that role, he oversaw the settling of charges against the company levied by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Arizona Attorney General. Also under his watch, Theranos resolved a $140 million lawsuit brought by Walgreens (its former commercial partner) and a $96.1 million lawsuit brought by an investor, and secured a $100 million debt facility from Fortress Investment Group. Taylor became Theranos' CEO in June 2018 when founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes stepped down. Holmes' resignation came after she was charged with defrauding Theranos investors and patients. &&&&& &&&&& Immediately prior to joining Theranos, Taylor worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson, where he received the ACLU Foundation of Southern Californiaâ€™s Humanitarian Award in June 2015 and was part of a team that won the California Lawyer Attorneys of the Year award in March 2016. He previously practiced at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia and Williams & Connolly LLP. He received a Bachelor's Degree from Williams College and a JD from the UC Berkeley School of Law. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Duško Tarbuk &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Duško Tarbuk''' (; born August 21, 1972) is a politician in Serbia. He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2016 as a member of the Serbian Progressive Party. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and career &&&&& Tarbuk was born in the Belgrade municipality of Zemun, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He was raised in Belgrade, studied marketing and industry at Union University, and was employed by various marketing firms from 1995 to 2008. He became assistant director of the public company "Rasveta" in 2015. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Tarbuk was for many years a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (''Demokratska stranka Srbije'', DSS), at one time serving as the president of its municipal organization in Zemun. Following the 2008 Serbian local elections, he led the DSS into a coalition government in Zemun with the far-right Serbian Radical Party and in the process became the municipality's deputy president (i.e., deputy mayor). When this government was dismissed in March 2009, he was appointed as the DSS representative on a new provisional council – although the party, which opposed the transition, initially said that he would boycott the new government's proceedings. Tarbuk ultimately continued to play an administrative role in Zemun's government until 2015, serving in this time as assistant to the president. &&&&& &&&&& In March 2014, it was reported that Tarbuk and fellow DSS organizer Petar Bojović became involved in a serious altercation with one another at a party function. &&&&& &&&&& Tarbuk subsequently joined the Progressive Party and received the fifty-fifth position on the party's ''Aleksandar Vučić — Serbia is winning'' electoral list for the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election and elected when the list won a landslide victory with 131 out of 250 mandates. He is currently a member of the assembly's environmental protection committee; a deputy member of the defence and internal affairs committee, the committee on Kosovo-Metohija, and the committee on finance, state budget, and control of public spending; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

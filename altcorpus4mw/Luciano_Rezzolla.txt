Luciano Rezzolla &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Luciano Rezzolla''' (born 1967) is an Italian professor of relativistic astrophysics and &&&&& numerical relativity at the Goethe University Frankfurt. His main field of study is the physics and astrophysics of compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& Born in Milan, Italy, in 1967, Rezzolla completed his undergraduate degree in physics &&&&& at the University of Bari and University of Trieste. After a year in the Italian Navy as submarine officer, he studied at SISSA and received his PhD in 1997 under the supervision of John C. Miller. &&&&& &&&&& Academic career &&&&& After completing a postdoc at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign studying black holes and neutron stars, he returned to SISSA as a research fellow, and ultimately an Associate Professor. In 2006 he became Head of the Numerical Relativity group at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany specialising in the numerical simulations of binary black holes and binary neutron stars. In 2013, he moved to Goethe University to fill the Chair of Theoretical Astrophysics. &&&&& &&&&& Together with collaborators in 2001, he has shown that r-modes in a neutron star will generate differential rotation, which could amplify the magnetic field and suppress the instability. In 2003, he proposed that the QPOs that are measured in harmonic ratios in high-mass X-ray binaries can be explained simply in terms of trapped p-mode oscillations of an accretion torus around the black hole. Together with collaborators in 2011, he showed that the merger of magnetised neutron stars leads to the formation of a black hole and highly magnetised torus from which a magnetic jet structure develops which provides a link between the theoretical modelling and observation of a jet in short gamma-ray bursts. In 2013, together with Heino Falcke he has proposed that blitzars could be an explanation &&&&& for fast radio bursts. Blitzars would &&&&& occur when a supramassive rotating neutron star slows down enough, loses &&&&& its magnetic field and then turns into a black hole. He has also worked on gravastars and found that the merger of black holes from GW150914 is not consistent with the gravastar model. &&&&& &&&&& Alongside Heino Falcke and Michael Kramer, he received a &&&&& 14 million euro research grant of the European Research Council for further &&&&& studies into black holes with the goal to construct a black hole camera using the Event Horizon Telescope. This would allow testing of general theory of relativity by creating an image of the black hole shadow. &&&&& &&&&& With Olindo Zanotti, he has written a textbook "Relativistic Hydrodynamics". &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Rezzolla is an avid sailor and currently lives in Potsdam with his wife, Carolin Schneider, and three children, Anna, Emilia and Dominik. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Personal website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

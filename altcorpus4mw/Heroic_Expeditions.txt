Heroic Expeditions &&&&& Introduction &&&&& right &&&&& '''''Heroic Expeditions''''' is a 1981 fantasy role-playing game adventure published by Judges Guild. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Heroic Expeditions'' presents three separate quests designed for three specific sets of characters: "Spear of Darkness," "Quest for the Book of Ancestry," and "Cave of Despair". &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& J. David George reviewed ''Heroic Expeditions'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 50. George commented that "Any of these three quests ''could'' have been interesting, were they given more background and published separately in a more complete form. "Cave," the best of the three, can only be described as ''almost'' clever. For the most part, even novice referees would be better off designing their own quests than using those presented in ''Heroic Expeditions''." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

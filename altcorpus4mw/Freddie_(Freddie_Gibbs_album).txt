Meaghan Garvey of ''Pitchfork'' wrote that ''Freddie'' "feels like a pure and reckless purge from Gibbs, a collection that finds him at his wildest and most essential." Critic A. Harmony of Exclaim! called ''Freddie'' "trolling-as-marketing done right: Gibbs juxtaposes the silky, colourful imagery of vintage R&B with crude beats and tight, blissfully vulgar verses that demand to be replayed at ignorant levels." Online hip hop publication ''HotNewHipHop'' concluded that ''Freddie'' is Gibbs' "most sublime work yet; by opening with the plight of his youth and concluding with the sampled whispers of his three-year-old daughter, Freddie Gibbs manages to present a more vivid glimpse into the soul of his art than any other major rap artist this past month." Riley Wallace of ''HipHopDX'' commented that "the 10-song effort delivers an experience that fans of Gangsta Gibbs have come to expect after the last two projects: glimmering gems scattered among a curated blend of believable, high-quality gangsterism." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& Credits adapted from Freddie Gibbs' official Instagram. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& Credits adapted from Freddie Gibbs' official Instagram. &&&&& &&&&& '''Technical''' &&&&& * Kenny Beats – recording, mixing &&&&& * RichGains – recording &&&&& * Sid "Speakerbomb" Miller – recording &&&&& * Eric "Enstrumentals" Sandoval – recording &&&&& * TJ Jacobs – mastering &&&&& &&&&& '''Additional personnel''' &&&&& * Ben "Lambo" Lambert – creative direction, A&R &&&&& * RichGains – A&R &&&&& * Nima Etminan – project management (Empire) &&&&& * Eamon Mulligan – project management (Empire) &&&&& * Scottie Cameron – photography &&&&& * Vlad Sepetov – art, graphic design &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& New Zealand Heatseeker Albums (RMNZ) &&&&& &&&&& 7 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Hof Ásatrúarfélagsins &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Hof Ásatrúarfélagsins''' is a religious building under construction in Reykjavík, Iceland. When finished it will be used by the Heathen organization Ásatrúarfélagið for religious ceremonies, concerts and exhibitions. It is Iceland's first major hof to the Norse gods since the Viking Age. It is located on the southern slope of the hill Öskjuhlíð, close to Reykjavík University. The project has been under development since 2005, but suffered several delays. It has been under construction since 2015. &&&&& &&&&& Architecture and design &&&&& A memorial for Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson stands next to the building site since 2010. &&&&& Hof Ásatrúarfélagsins was designed by the Icelandic architect and Ásatrúarfélagið member Magnús Jensson. Jensson wanted the building to look timeless and neither be a Viking Age pastiche nor specifically modern. The aim was to represent a close relationship to earth, sky and sun. The design incorporates numbers and geometry considered sacred by Ásatrúarfélagið, such as the numbers nine, 432,000 and the golden ratio. &&&&& &&&&& The building is made of concrete and local wood. The main part will have an area of 350 square metres and hold a maximum of 250 people. It has an oval shape and an inverted dome on top to let in sunlight which changes on a daily and seasonal basis. It is built into the side of the hill and uses natural rock as one of its walls, allowing water to flow down the stone wall and be collected in pools. &&&&& &&&&& Next to the building is a memorial stone for Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson, Ásatrúarfélagið's first ''allsherjargoði''. The monument was dedicated on 22 April 2010 with a ceremony that paid tribute to the local ''landvættir'' and several gods. &&&&& &&&&& The design allows the building to be expanded in the future. According to Ásatrúarfélagið's ''allsherjargoði'' Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, there are preliminary plans for an expansion that would provide a facility for international research on subjects related to mythology. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& In 2005, Ásatrúarfélagið decided to sell its house in Reykjavík which it had acquired in 1998. The real-estate value had at this point increased so much that the organization's long-time goal of building a hof in Reykjavík for its activities had become a realistic project. Ásatrúarfélagið originally applied for a plot of land for a religious building in Elliðaárdalur. Reykjavík's mayor Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir instead suggested a location on the hill Öskjuhlíð, which Ásatrúarfélagið accepted in 2006. However, this plot turned out to be within the safety zone of the Reykjavík Airport, so a new location nearby, on the southern slope of the same hill, was assigned in 2008. Ásatrúarfélagið and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson were especially pleased by the proximity between this location and the Reykjavík University. &&&&& &&&&& The land was donated by the city and the construction funds were provided by Ásatrúarfélagið. On 1 September 2008, five architectural firms submitted their respective proposals for the building's design to Ásatrúarfélagið's building committee. When the building still was on a planning stage, the 2008 Icelandic banking collapse took place, which resulted in substantial financial losses for Ásatrúarfélagið, and the hof project was delayed by several years. In January 2015, Magnús Jensson's design was eventually revealed and it was reported that construction was soon to begin. The building was reported to have a construction cost of 130 million Icelandic krónas. &&&&& &&&&& Construction &&&&& Construction broke ground at the solar eclipse of 20 March 2015. The building was then projected to be finished in the late summer of 2016. However, the complicated design has caused technical problems and further delays. In December 2017 it was expected to be finished by the end of 2018. In February 2019, Hilmar Örn said that the most optimistic expectation was for the building to be finished in December 2019, although he hoped that parts of the building would be ready for active use already in the autumn that year. He explained that it is the dome that is causing problems and that the project has gone severely over its original budget, with the costs now estimated at around 270 million krónas. He also revealed that Ásatrúarfélagið had looked at different models for potentially crowdfunding parts of the costs, although stressed that the funders in that case must get something in return for their money. He explained it as crucial for the organization's dignity to not take a bank loan. &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& The name used in the media and promotional material, "''hof Ásatrúarfélagsins''", is descriptive and simply means "The hall of the ōs faith association" or "The temple of the ōs faith association". The association has asked the public for proposals for the building's official name, but the final decision will be taken shortly before the consecration. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * List of modern Pagan temples &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * The architect's website about the building &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

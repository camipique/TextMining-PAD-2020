German House (Seattle) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''German House''' is a building in the First Hill area of Seattle, Washington, which since its construction in 1886 has variously functioned as an office block, an entertainment hall and, until 1932, the city's assay office. Following World War II the building returned to the possession of its previous German-American owners; it continues today to be a popular venue for German-themed events in Seattle. It was designated a Seattle Landmark in 1983. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as '''Assay Office''' in 1972. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The structure's history dates back to 1886 when local newspaper publisher and civic leader Thomas Prosch built it to function as both an entertainment center and office block under the name of '''Prosch Hall'''. Prosch was also a collector of photographs by local photographers and wrote books on the Puget Sound region. It was taken over by the Federal government with the support of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and used as an assay office from July 1898 due to the need of gold miners in the Pacific Northwest to have such an establishment in closer proximity (previously the nearest assay office had been in San Francisco). By the following year it was taking in more gold than any other assay office in the United States. &&&&& &&&&& By the late 1920s gold deposits had declined markedly and, in 1932, the building ceased to be used as an assay office. In 1935 the building was taken over by Deutsches Haus (German Club), an organization for Seattleites of German descent, becoming their social center. It was used as a Navy entertainment center during World War II before returning to the possession of its previous German owners. Today, its affairs are administered by the German Heritage Society in Seattle; it plays host to a diverse array of Germanic activities including traditional concerts and balls. Lectures on the building's historic roots have also taken place here. &&&&& &&&&& On July 6, 1983, the city of Seattle's Landmark Preservation Board designated German House as a Seattle Landmark. It had previously been added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 1972. &&&&& &&&&& In November 2011 a German-themed café named "Kafé Berlin" opened on the first floor of the building; however, by 2016 it had closed permanently. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * German Heritage Society, Seattle &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 		 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

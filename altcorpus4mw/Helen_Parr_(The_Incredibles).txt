Helen Parr (The Incredibles) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Helen Parr''' (n√©e '''Truax''') is a fictional superhero, created by Brad Bird for the Pixar franchise ''The Incredibles''. The character is voiced by Holly Hunter in the films and in the ''Disney Infinity'' video game franchise, while Elizabeth Daily and Ally Johnson voiced her in ''The Incredibles'' video game and ''Lego The Incredibles''. Helen has an elasticity-based superpower that allows her body to stretch and contort in a variety of ways. Helen Parr is also known by her superhero name '''Elastigirl'''. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& When designing the Incredibles family, Brad Bird wanted each of their superpowers to be related to their personality. He felt that as a mother, Helen was required by society to be pulled in many different directions, which led to her being given an elastic ability. &&&&& &&&&& Regarding the choice to make Helen the star of ''Incredibles 2'', Bird insisted that it was unrelated with the #MeToo movement, and was instead a choice that came naturally with how the writers wanted to progress the story. &&&&& &&&&& Appearances &&&&& In ''The Incredibles'' (2004), Helen is seen as Elastigirl in the time before superheroes are banned. She married Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and starts a family: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. She gives up her vigilante job to become a housewife while her husband worked. When Bob starts to act sneakily, Helen suspects an affair and confronts him. Later, when she discovered her husband is in trouble, she pilots a jet to rescue him, accompanied by Violet and Dash. &&&&& &&&&& In ''Incredibles 2'' (2018), the main plot of the film involves Helen becoming the face of a campaign to make superheroes legal again by giving them good public relations through successful missions that don't cause collateral damage to the city. Although she ends up becoming Evelyn's victim, she is then rescued by her children, with Helen finally learns of Jack-Jack's first of 17 superhuman abilities. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Syfy Wire praised the sequel for making its hero a "kickass mom". &&&&& &&&&& Upon the release of ''Incredibles 2'', there was some discourse surrounding the sexualisation of Helen's character. Hundreds of fans on social media described the character as "thicc", a slang term referring to having large buttocks combined with a narrow waist, while ''The New Yorker'' likened the character to Anastasia Steele from ''Fifty Shades of Grey''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

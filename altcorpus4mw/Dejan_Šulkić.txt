Dejan Šulkić &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Dejan Šulkić''' () is a politician in Serbia. He was the mayor of Velika Plana from 2004 to 2015 and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2016. Šulkić is a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (''Demokratska stranka Srbije'', DSS). &&&&& &&&&& Early life and career &&&&& Šulkić was born in Velika Plana, then part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of the University of Kragujevac Faculty of Law. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& ===Mayor=== &&&&& Šulkić first became mayor of Velika Plana via a direct election in the 2004 Serbian local elections. He was retained in the position following the 2008 and 2012 local elections, in which mayors were indirectly elected by municipal assemblies. His tenure in office ended in August 2015 when the Democratic Party (''Demokratska stranka'', DS) ended its alliance with the DSS and formed a new local coalition government with the Serbian Progressive Party. &&&&& &&&&& ===DSS executive and member of the National Assembly=== &&&&& Šulkić received the 219th position on the DSS's electoral list in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won fifty-three mandates, and he was not included in its assembly delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Šulkić could have been selected to receive a mandate despite his low position on the list, although in the event she was not). &&&&& &&&&& Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Šulkić received the fifty-second position on the DSS's list for the 2012 parliamentary election. The list won twenty-two mandates, and he was again not elected. He was chosen as president of the DSS's executive board in June 2015. &&&&& &&&&& The DSS contested the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election in an alliance with Dveri. Šulkić received the sixth position on their combined list and was this time elected when the list won thirteen mandates. The election was won by the Progressive Party and its allies, and Šulkić serves in opposition. &&&&& &&&&& The DSS parliamentary group fell apart amid internal divisions in November 2016. In the aftermath of the split, Šulkić, Gorica Gajić, and Milan Lapčević were the only assembly members to remain with the party; as five members are needed to form a parliamentary group, all sat as independents. Lapčević subsequently left the DSS. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2017, Šulkić was chosen as one of three DSS vice-presidents. He is currently a member of the assembly committee on constitutional and legislative issues and the committee on the diaspora and Serbs in the region; a deputy member of the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Macedonia, Montenegro, and Slovenia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Law Officers Act 1997 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Law Officers Act 1997''' is an Act of Parliament which allowed the Attorney General for England and Wales and for Northern Ireland to delegate powers to the Solicitor General for England and Wales. Previously, the Solicitor General was separately and explicitly granted some of the same powers of the Attorney General. This Act effectively made the Solicitor General an agent of the Attorney General. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& ===Section 1=== &&&&& This section allows the Solicitor General to do things in the name of the Attorney General, effectively allowing them to delegate powers to the Solicitor General. &&&&& &&&&& ===Section 2=== &&&&& This section effectively extends Section 1's provisions to Northern Ireland.

Elizabeth A. Winzeler &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Elizabeth Ann Winzeler''' is an American microbiologist. She is a professor in the division of host-microbe systems and therapeutics of the School of Medicine of the University of California at San Diego. Her research group there is working on better medicines for the treatment and eradication of malaria; in 2017 it received a three-year grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to further this research. In 2016 she was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Dr. Winzeler attended Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon where she first intended to become an art major, but when she took physics with Professor of Physics Robert Deery during senior year she discovered she liked mathematics and was good at it. She added a major in Natural Sciences and received her B.A. in Natural Sciences and Art in 1984. After college, she learned to be a computer programmer by working at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, D.C. She then returned to academia to receive her M.S. in Biophysics and Biochemistry in 1990 at Oregon State Universityin Corvallis, Oregon. In 1996, she was awarded the Ph.D. from Stanford University in Developmental Biology. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& From 2007 to 2012, Winzeler headed the Department of Cellular Biology at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. From 2010 to 2012, she was also Associate Professor in the Department of Genetics and Department of Immunology & Microbial Science at Scripps Research Institute. In 2012, she became Professor of Pediatrics at University of California, San Diego and Director of Translational Research at the UCSD Heath Sciences Center for Immunity, Infection, and Inflammation. &&&&& Malaria parasite life cycle &&&&& &&&&& Research &&&&& While she was still at Stanford University she published papers on yeast genomics. In San Diego she has worked extensively with the malaria parasite, both on its genomics and on generating new possible treatments for infections with malaria. ''Plasmodium falciparum'', the malaria parasite, enters red blood cells of a human host in part of its life cycle and thus protects itself, but Winkeler saw that details of the genome annotation and of the transcriptome (the gene expression viewed as messenger RNAs present) could open new avenues for attack. She used the information her laboratory developed to design high-throughput drug discovery protocols. In addition, Winzeler has discovered the basis of some of the drug resistance mutations in the parasite. The laboratory has discovered several potential malarial treatment drugs, resulting in a $4.7 million dollar grant from the Gates Foundation to continue this work. &&&&& &&&&& Awards and honors &&&&& &&&&& *American Academy of Microbiology 2016 &&&&& * Howard T.

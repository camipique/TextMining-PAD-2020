272	Force-sensing_capacitor
Force-sensing capacitor &&&&& Introduction &&&&& A '''force-sensing capacitor''' is a material whose capacitance changes when a force, pressure or mechanical stress is applied. They are also known as "force-sensitive capacitors". They can provide improved sensitivity and repeatability compared to force-sensitive resistors but traditionally required more complicated electronics. &&&&& &&&&& Operation principle &&&&& Typical force sensitive capacitors are examples of parallel plate capacitors. For small deflections, there is a linear relationship between applied force and change in capacitance, which can be shown as follows: &&&&& &&&&& The capacitance, , equals , where is permeability, is the area of the sensor and is the distance between parallel plates. If the material is linearly elastic (so follows Hooks Law), then the displacement, due to an applied force , is , where is the spring constant. Combining these equations gives the capacitance after an applied force as: &&&&& &&&&& :, where is the separation between parallel plates when no force is applied. &&&&& &&&&& This can be rearranged to: &&&&& &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Assuming that , which is true for small deformations where , we can simplify this to: &&&&& &&&&& :C &&&&& &&&&& It follows that: &&&&& &&&&& :C &&&&& :C where , which is constant for a given sensor.  &&&&& &&&&& We can express the change in capacitance as: &&&&& &&&&& : &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& SingleTact makes force-sensitive capacitors using moulded silicon between two layers of polymide to construct a 0.35mm thick sensor, with force ranges from 1N to 450N. The 8mm SingleTact has a nominal capacitance of 75pF, which increases by 2.2pF when the rated force is applied. &&&&& &&&&& Uses &&&&& Force-sensing capacitors can be used to create low-profile force-sensitive buttons. They have been used in medical imaging to map pressures in the esophagusand to image breast and prostate cancer. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

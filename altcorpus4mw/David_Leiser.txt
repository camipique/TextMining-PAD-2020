Leiser served as Chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences (1995-1997), of the Department of Psychology (2006-2008) and as Acting Chair of the department of inter-disciplinary Studies (2009-2010). &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Leiser held Visiting Positions at the University of Chicago (1976-1977), MIT (1986-1987), Harvard and Yale (2007), Paris V (René Descartes) (1993-1994) and Paris II (Panthéon — Assas) (2017). &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& He was Associate Editor of the Journal of Economic Psychology. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& He is conversant in eight languages: French, Hebrew, English, Flemish, Yiddish, German, Latin and Italian. &&&&& &&&&& Published works &&&&& ===Books=== &&&&& *'''How We Misunderstand Economics And Why It Matters: The Psychology of Bias, Distortion and Conspiracy''', coauthored with Yhonatan Shemesh, was published by Routledge in 2018. The book explores why laypeople have difficulty comprehending economics, both micro and macro. The authors point out specific challenges presented by economic reasoning (both micro and macro) including aggregation, the systemic approach, and equilibrium, and identify fundamental limitations of human cognition: short range and narrow scope. When people try to interpret economic situations, most look for direct reasons and tend to overlook indirect causes and feedback effects. In addition, people suffer from the intentionality bias, whereby causes are attributed to willful actions and individuals rather than factors at the aggregate level where most economic thinking takes place. &&&&& &&&&& In consequence, proper understanding cannot be achieved without training. In everyday life, the public has access to tools that create a semblance of understanding, but it is mostly illusory. These include application of personality traits, relying on metaphors, embracing an ideology, and using the Good-Begets-Good heuristic, &&&&& &&&&& whereby economic indicators judged to be good are lumped together with those that are bad. This causes most people to believe that inflation and unemployment co-vary. &&&&& &&&&& Misunderstanding economics by the public has some economic consequences arising directly from their behavior, but the impact is mainly due to the superficial and populist policies they tend to support. &&&&& &&&&& The authors argue that it is impossible to explain every policy decision to the public. They are skeptical about what financial and economic education can achieve. They recommend engaging the public and explaining policy choices that are intelligible whenever possible, and thereby acquire a measure of trust that can serve policymakers when factors are too complex for the layman to understand. &&&&& &&&&& *'''Cognitive Science and Genetic Epistemology - a Case Study of Understanding''' &&&&& Leiser wrote this book together with Christiane Gillièron, it was published in Plenum, 1990 and Springer, 2012. Foreword by Bärbel Inhelder. &&&&& &&&&& This book addresses two profoundly different approaches to cognitive functioning: the structural approach of Jean Piaget that focuses on the construction and application of logico-mathematical structures to structure the world, and the information processing approach, which is predominant today and focuses on the successive mental actions applied when performing a particular task. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Using the seriation task as a case study, the book analyzes the interplay of both aspects, the structural and the procedural. In particular, their analysis shows that, contrary to the classic claim by Piaget, transitivity is neither necessary nor sufficient to succeed in the seriation task &&&&& &&&&& ===Selected articles=== &&&&& *Leiser, D., Duani, N., & Wagner-Egger, P.

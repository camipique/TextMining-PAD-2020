Italian prisoners of war in Australia &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Italian prisoners of war in Australia''' were Italian soldiers captured by the British and Allied Forces in World War II and taken to Australia. &&&&& &&&&& On 10 June 1940, Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany. During the course of the war, Great Britain and their allies captured in Ethiopia and North Africa approximately 400,000 Italian troops, who were sent to POW camps all over the world, including Australia.  &&&&& &&&&& Between 1941 and 1945, Australia received custody of 18,420 Italian POWs. The bulk came from British camps in India. During this time prisoners wore burgundy/maroon clothing. Then, after Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the Australian authorities took between 13,000 and 15,000 Italian prisoners out of the POW camps and put them to work. &&&&& &&&&& Over the period, several POWs escaped internment camps, at least one was shot for allegedly trying to escape from a camp, one suicided in a camp,, fights between fascist versus anti-fascist supporting prisoners, and others was charged with criminal offences. At least one was named as a party to divorce proceedings. &&&&& &&&&& Research undertaken of POWs in northern New South Wales indicated newspapers carried much anti-Italian sentiment: Unionists held concerns unpaid Italian POW labour would displace existing Australian labour; Inequality of Italian POWs had greater freedoms and better food than Australian POWs in overseas camps; and POWs should not be allowed to return to Australia post-war. On an individual level, rapport occurred between landowners and their POW labourers.  &&&&& &&&&& One brand of red wine currently produced in Australia is called "Rabbit & Spaghetti", this being the customary diet of Italian POWs in Australia. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * List of POW camps in Australia &&&&& * Italian Australians &&&&& * Italian prisoners of war in the Soviet Union &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& &&&&& * Italian POWs in Australia &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Flordon Common &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Flordon Common''' is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest south-east of Wymondham in Norfolk. It is a registered common part of the Norfolk Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation. &&&&& &&&&& Springs emerge from this chalk valley of the River Tas, resulting in a species-rich calcareous fen, including the very rare narrow-mouthed whorl snail. On higher ground there is chalk grassland, which is traditionally managed by grazing, allowing the survival of many locally rare plants. &&&&& &&&&& The common is open to the public. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Hold On To The Good Things &&&&& Introduction &&&&& "Hold on to the Good Things" is a song written by Roxanne Seeman and Holly Knight. It is the second end-credit song for the film Stuart Little 2. It was recorded by Shawn Colvin for the film and included in the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack, released on July 19, 2002. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& &&&&& Bonnie Greenberg and Christy Gerhardt, music supervisors for Stuart Little 2, sent Roxanne Seeman the script for Stuart Little 2, asking whether she would write a song. Roxanne Seeman wrote the song with Holly Knight. &&&&& &&&&& "Hold on to the Good Things" was written specifically for a montage scene in the movie where the family is in the dining room. During a long period of editing where changes were made to scenes in the movie, the recording of the song was put on hold. By the time "Hold On To The Good Things" was recorded, the movie was locked, hence it was chosen for the second end-credit song, out of 120 songs under consideration. &&&&& &&&&& Soundtrack &&&&& &&&&& After Glen Brunman of Sony Music Soundtrax heard “Hold On To The Good Things”, the lyrics in the chorus were revised: the words “silvery lining” from the last line of the second verse going into the chorus, was repeated as “silver lining” in the second line of the chorus, replacing “kindness”. &&&&& &&&&& During the recording session, Shawn Colvin recorded both lyric versions. The original unedited version was used in the film. An edited version with the lyric revision in the chorus appears on the soundtrack. &&&&& &&&&& The song was produced by Marc Tanner. Ken Karman was the music editor of the film &&&&& &&&&& The soundtrack, ''Music from and Inspired by Stuart Little 2'', was released by Epic Records on July 19, 2002 on Audio CD and Compact Cassette. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

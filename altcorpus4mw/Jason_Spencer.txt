Jason Spencer &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jason Chauncey Spencer''' (born November 14, 1974) is an American physician assistant and politician. He was elected as a Republican to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2010, representing district 180. Steven Sainz defeated Jason Spencer in the 2018 Republican primary for Georgia House of Representatives District 180 on May 22, 2018. Spencer faced criticism in July 2018 after being featured in the second episode of the satire show ''Who Is America?'', in which he partially disrobed and flashed his buttocks, and screamed racial epithets after being prompted by a disguised Sacha Baron Cohen as part of what Baron Cohen claimed to be counter-terrorism training. Spencer later announced that he would resign from the Georgia House of Representatives effective July 31, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Spencer was born into a military family at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. The family moved to Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Georgia, in 1978 and to Alapaha, Georgia, a year later. Spencer graduated from Berrien High School in 1993. &&&&& &&&&& He attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College before transferring to Alabama State University, a historically black college (HBCU), on a full athletic scholarship for tennis. He transferred again to the University of Georgia, from which he graduated with a degree in exercise & sport science in 1997. &&&&& &&&&& Spencer trained as a physician assistant, receiving a second bachelor's degree from South University in Savannah and a master's degree in physician assistant studies from the University of Nebraska Medical Center in 2005. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& ===Electoral history=== &&&&& An active member of the Tea Party movement in coastal Georgia, Spencer was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2010 after defeating incumbent Cecily Hill in a primary runoff. His district centers on Woodbine in southeastern Georgia. He was reelected in 2012, 2014, and 2016. In May 2018, he was defeated by a primary challenger, 24-year-old political newcomer Steven Sainz. A local party leader attributed Spencer's loss in part to his "antics" in office. However, Spencer said "if he rubbed anyone the wrong way" he was doing so by standing up to powerful special interest representing the plight of "little guy." “My tactics won against them and that is one of the reasons why I stayed in office for eight years, because I effectively beat them at their own game,” said Spencer to the Brunswick News. In a radio interview with WGIG 1440 AM, Rep. Jason Spencer stated he was often a target of many on the ideological left and by establishment politicians in leadership for introducing legislation that challenged powerful special interests, such as those who blocked a bill that the legislator nearly passed that would have extended civil justice to survivors of child sexual abuse. &&&&& &&&&& ===Tenure and controversies=== &&&&& During his time in office, Spencer was one of the most fervent opponents of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the Georgia House of Representatives. He authored legislation that effectively blocked Medicaid expansion in Georgia and legislation blocking the establishment its own insurance marketplace as well as forcing the University of Georgia to terminate its "Obamacare" Navigator program under the Act. In 2014, Spencer introduced legislation to block the state from "using of its resources to implement any portions of the health care law." When this legislation was tabled by Senate Majority Whip Cecil Staton (R-Macon) and other opponents in committee, he issued a press release blaming fellow Republicans for an "eleventh hour betrayal" and likening them to "Benedict Arnolds, the King George the Third and his myrmidons." &&&&& &&&&& In 2016, after facing bipartisan opposition, Spencer withdrew a bill that was perceived to have banned Muslim women from wearing religious garments like burqas or niqābs in driver's license photographs or while driving cars. The legislation aimed to amend an existing 1951 Georgia law that was constitutionally upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court ( ''State v Miller'', 1990) to unmask members of the Ku Klux Klan. Many, including the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) and American Civil Liberties Union, accused Spencer of Islamophobia. Spencer accused a constituent of treason and supporting terrorism for donating $10 to CAIR Georgia in response to his bill. Spencer supported his charge of potential treason in a letter written to his constituent stating that CAIR was designated as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates due to the organization's alleged ties to Hamas, an organization which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State. In addition, Spencer stated that CAIR was named by the U.S. Justice Department as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism funding trials in U.S. history, known as ''United States v Holy Land Foundation, et. al.''., claims which CAIR has rejected. As a result of the backlash of submitting this legislation, Spencer said he received death threats after proposing the legislation. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, Spencer attracted controversy in the debate over the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. In a Facebook post, he issued a warning to an African American attorney, former House colleague and Bernie Sanders' Presidential Campaign State Director LaDawn Jones that she might "go missing in the Okefenokee," a swamp in southern Georgia (and partly in Spencer's district), if she followed through on her intentions to bring advocates to southern Georgia to remove Confederate monuments. &&&&& &&&&& Spencer was featured on the July 22, 2018, episode of Sacha Baron Cohen's show ''Who Is America?''. At the urging of Baron Cohen, who posed as an Israeli counter-terrorism expert, Spencer exposed his bare buttocks, imitated a Chinese tourist using racial stereotypes, used a selfie stick to take an upskirt picture under a woman's burqa, and repeatedly yelled the word "nigger." Georgia House Speaker David Ralston urged Spencer to resign, saying that he had "disgraced himself." Governor Nathan Deal tweeted that Spencer's actions were "appalling and offensive." Spencer apologized for what he described as "this ridiculously ugly episode" but initially refused to step down, saying that the show's producers exploited his state of mind "for profit and notoriety" and that Baron Cohen and his crew had falsely promised he would be able to review and have final approval over any footage used. Spencer later announced his resignation on July 24, effective as of July 31. &&&&& &&&&& === Notable legislative mentions === &&&&& Prior to his resignation, Spencer was appointed to the following committees in the Georgia State House: Science & Technology; Games, Fish & Parks; Juvenile Justice; Human Aging & Relations and served as the Secretary to the House Special Rules Committee. &&&&& &&&&& During his time in the legislature, Spencer passed legislation that relaxed “live-aboard” boating restrictions and legalized home brew beer competitions in Georgia. &&&&& &&&&& Spencer served as an advocate for survivors of child sexual abuse where he introduced and passed landmark civil statute of limitations (SOL) reform legislation known as the Georgia Hidden Predator Act (HB 17, 2015).  This legislation removed or extended the civil SOL so survivors can gain access to justice and expose the identities of hidden pedophiles in the state of Georgia. The Hidden Predator Act was instrumental in leading to the unraveling of one of the largest sex scandals in U.S. sports history and the exposure of convicted serial child molester Dr. Larry Nassar.  Rep. Spencer received Voice Today's "Voice of Gratitude Award" for his efforts authoring the legislation. In 2018, Spencer attempted to amend the 2015 law with more substantial language to strengthen it, but the bill was weakened by lobbying efforts from the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America and other powerful interests groups where it narrowly failed to pass on the last day of the 2018 legislative session. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, Spencer introduced and passed key legislation, known as the Georgia Space Flight Act (House Bill 1, 2017), to attract the commercial space industry to Georgia as part of an ongoing effort to establish Georgia's first commercial spaceport. &&&&& &&&&& ===Election results=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Spencer lives with his wife and their two daughters in Woodbine. They are members of the Harbor Worship Center, a Christian church in Kingsland, Georgia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Jason Spencer at the Georgia House of Representatives &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

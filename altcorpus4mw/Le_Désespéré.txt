Le Désespéré &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 300px &&&&& '''''Le Désespéré''''' (''Desperation'' or ''The Desperate Man'') is an 1843-1845 oil on canvas self-portrait by Gustave Courbet, produced early during his stay in Paris. It is now in the private collection of the Conseil Investissement Art BNP Paribas but was displayed in the Musée d'Orsay's 2007 Courbet exhibition &&&&& &&&&& ''The Man Made Mad with Fear'', unfinished gouache on paper sketch by Courbet (1843-1844, National Gallery of Norway). &&&&& In the 1840s Courbet produced portraits of his friends and clients as well as self-portraits, including ''Self-Portrait with a Black Dog'' (1842). He spent time in the Louvre copying works by José de Ribera, Zurbaran, Velasquez and Rembrandt which started to influence his work. He broke from his traditional vertical format for the work. He was attached to ''Le Désespéré'', taking it with him when he went into exile in Switzerland in 1873. A few years later doctor Paul Collin's description of Courbet's studio included a mention of "a painting showing Courbet with a desperate expression, for this reason entitled ''Désespoir''". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography (in French) &&&&& * ''Courbet'' sur le site du Musée d'Orsay &&&&& * ''Le désespéré'': une courte vidéo sur Dailymotion &&&&& * Coli Jorge : « L’Atelier de Courbet », in : ''Art Absolument'', Autumn 2007, no. 22, p. 59-63 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Courbet &&&&& category:19th-century portraits &&&&& category:1845 paintings &&&&& &&&&&

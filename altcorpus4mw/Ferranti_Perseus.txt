197	Ferranti_Perseus
Ferranti Perseus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Perseus''' was a vacuum tube (valve) computer built by Ferranti, Ltd of Great Britain. It was a development of the Ferranti Pegasus computer for large-scale data processing. It had a processing unit which used many of the same parts as Pegasus and an off-line unit for printing on a line printer from half-inch magnetic tape. Two were sold, both to overseas insurance companies in 1959. &&&&& &&&&& Design &&&&& The design aim of Perseus was to enable large-scale data-processing, rather than scientific computing. It used the same electronic technology as the Ferranti Pegasus, similarly engineered. The envisaged applications would involve vast amounts of file data for which 1/2" magnetic tape was provided. The word length was 72 bits with 160 words of random-access memory provided by single-word nickel acoustic delay lines. Unlike Pegasus with its magnetic drum, further internal store was provided by 864, 16-word delay lines. Large-scale data input was provided by punched card readers available for both round- and rectangular-hole cards. Data output was via magnetic tape to an off-line unit equipped with 300 lines per minute Samastronic line printers. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

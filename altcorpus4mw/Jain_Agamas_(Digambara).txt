Jain Agamas (Digambara) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Stela depicting ''Jinvani'' (''Śhrut Jnāna'') which forms the basis of Jain ''agamas'' &&&&& &&&&& '''Agamas''' are texts of Digambara Jainism based on the discourses of the ''tirthankara''. The originals are all lost, and the extant versions were written in the 1st millennium CE. They are believed by Digambaras to be Mahavira's discourses in a samavasarana (divine preaching hall). They are called ''Śhrut Jnāna'' and comprises twelve ''angas'' and fourteen ''purvas''. This forms the basis of the Jaina ''Agamas'' or canons. These are believed by Jains to have originated from Rishabhanatha, the first ''tirthankara'' who lived millions of years ago. &&&&& &&&&& The earliest versions of Jain Agamas known were composed in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. ''Agama'' is a Sanskrit word which signifies the 'coming' of a body of doctrine by means of transmission through a lineage of authoritative teachers. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Gautamasvami is said to have compiled the most sacred canonical scriptures comprising twelve parts, also referred to as eleven ''Angas'' and fourteen ''Pūrvas'', since the twelfth Anga comprises the fourteen ''Pūrvas''. These scriptures are said to have contained the most comprehensive and accurate description of every branch of learning that one needs to know. The knowledge contained in these scriptures was transmitted orally by the teachers to their disciple saints. &&&&& ''Agamas'' were lost during the same famine that the ''purvas'' were lost in. ''Āchārya Bhutabali'' was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later on, some learned ''Āchāryas'' started to restore, compile and put into written words the teachings of Lord Mahavira, that were the subject matter of ''Agamas''. ''Āchārya Dharasena'', in first century CE, guided two ''Āchāryas'', ''Āchārya Pushpadanta'' and ''Āchārya Bhutabali'', to put these teachings in the written form. The two ''Āchāryas'' wrote, on palm leaves, ''Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama''- among the oldest known Digambara Jaina texts. This was about 683 years after the ''nirvana'' of Mahavira. &&&&& &&&&& Angas &&&&& Table showing ''Anga scriptures'' &&&&& The ''Shruta-Jnana'' is contained in twelve ''Angas'' (lit. limbs). These include, among other things, the rules of conduct for ascetics and the laypeople, as well as the Jain theory of soul, matter and other substances. &&&&& &&&&& Jain literature &&&&& &&&&& Digambaras group texts into four literary categories called 'exposition' (''anuyoga''). The 'first' (''prathma'') exposition contains Digambara versions of the Universal History; the 'calculation' (''karana'') exposition contains works on cosmology; the 'behaviour' (''charana'') exposition includes texts about proper behaviour for monks and lay people; The 'substance' (''dravya'') exposition includes texts about ontology of the universe and self. &&&&& &&&&& Importance &&&&& For Jains, their scriptures represent the literal words of Mahāvīra and the other fordmakers only to the extent that the Agama is a series of beginning-less, endless and fixed truths, a tradition without any origin, human or divine, which in this world age has been channelled through Sudharma, the last of Mahavira's disciples to survive. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& Jinvani.jpg|Stela depicting Jinvani (Śhrut Jnāna) &&&&& Textsshahpur.jpg|Sacred Jain Books in a Temple Library &&&&& Westindischer Maler um 1400 001.jpg|Folio from a Kalpa Sūtra (Book of Sacred Precepts), c.

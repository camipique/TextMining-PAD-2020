Ferdinand Marcos presidential campaign, 1969 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''1969 reelection campaign of Ferdinand Marcos''', the 10th President of the Republic of the Philippines, started in July 1969 when incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos was unanimously nominated as the Presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party, and concluded when the 1969 Philippine presidential election concluded with Marcos winning an unprecedented second full term as President of the Philippines. With Fernando Lopez as his vice president, he ran against the Liberal Party slate of, Sergio Osmena, Jr and Genaro Magsaysay. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Ferdinand Marcos won his first campaign for the Philippine Presidency in November 1965, and was inaugurated just before new year's day in December the same year. Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four year terms as President. &&&&& &&&&& Formal Nomination &&&&& The formal beginning of the 1969 campaign can be dated to the July 1969 meeting of the Philippines' Nacionalista Party, in which Ferdinand Marcos was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate. A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous. &&&&& &&&&& "Guns, goons, and gold" &&&&& With his popularity already beefed up by debt-funded spending, Marcos' popularity made it very likely that he would win the election, but he decided, as National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin reported in the Philippines Free Press, to "''leave nothing to chance''." Time and Newsweek would eventually call the 1969 election the "''dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt''" in Philippine modern history, with the term "Three Gs", meaning "''guns, goons, and gold''" coined to describe administration's election tactics of vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching. &&&&& &&&&& Marcos used the military and the government bureaucracy for his campaign, with members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines participating in putting up campaign propaganda. &&&&& &&&&& Marcos also launched USD50 million worth in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate. This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972. Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osmena spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone. &&&&& &&&&& === Election violence === &&&&& The most violent election-related incidents took place in Batanes, where Philippine Constabulary officers, paramilitary groups, and hired guns essentially took over the island, and motorcycle-riding thugs rode around terrorizing voters and Comelec officials, and beating up opposition leaders. &&&&& &&&&& Results &&&&& Presidential, legislative and local elections were held on November 11, 1969, resulting in an unprecedented second full term as President of the Philippines for Incumbent President Marcos. Incumbent Vice President Fernando Lopez was also elected to a third full term as Vice President of the Philippines. Twelve other candidates ran for president, however ten of those were widely considered "nuisance candidates," and did not garner a significant number of votes in the election. &&&&& &&&&& In popular media &&&&& * The 1977 Eddie Romero classic Banta ng Kahapon starring Vic Vargas, Bembol Roco, Roland Dantes and Chanda Romero was set during the 1969 campaign period. The motiff of "guns, goons, and gold" was prominently featured. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Ferdinand Marcos &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

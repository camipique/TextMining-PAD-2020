132	Johanne_Spindler
Johanne Spindler &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Johanne Spindler''' (1781-1861), was a Danish ballet dancer and stage actress. She was regarded as one of the elite members of the Royal Danish Ballet in 1790-1806, and as an actress of the Royal Danish Theatre in 1799-1829. She attracted attention also for her private life - in 1806, she divorced her first husband and was forced to pay him allowance, which was almost unique for a woman in contemporary Denmark. After her second marriage to a rich man in 1811, she continued to work (which was also unusual for an actress married to a non-artist in that epoch) and also attracted attention by being able to play the role of upper class woman onstage wearing actual jewels. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *  Johanne Spindler in ''Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

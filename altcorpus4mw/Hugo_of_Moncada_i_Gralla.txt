Hugo of Moncada i Gralla &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Defeat of the Spanish Armada.'''Hugo of Montcada i Gralla''' was a Barcelona military man who commanded the ''Galleasses'' of Naples in the so-called Invincible Armada. He was the second son of Francesc I de Montcada, first Marquess of Aitona and Count of Osona, and his wife, Lucrècia Gralla. &&&&& &&&&& Belonging to the noble family of Montcada, his brother Gastó of Montcada i Gralla (first-born of 17 children) inherited the immense family fortune. His other brother was Joan of Montcada i Gralla, Archbishop of Tarragona ( 1613 - 1622 ) and Bishop of Barcelona ( 1610-1612 ). &&&&& &&&&& Participation in the Invincible Armada &&&&& &&&&& === Charge === &&&&& Hugo of Montcada was appointed commander of the fleet of Naples. The flagship was the San Lorenzo ''Galleass''. The ''Galleass-galleon'' La Girona was part of that fleet. The four ''Galleasses'' were: &&&&& &&&&& * The San Lorenzo (captain-ship of the fleet of Naples) -Captain Joan Setantí. &&&&& * The Zúñiga (patron-ship of the fleet of Naples) -Captain Pere Centelles &&&&& *The Girona -Captain Fabrizio Spínola, Genoese. &&&&& * The Napolitana -Captain Perrucchio Morán &&&&& &&&&& === Galleass San Lorenzo === &&&&& A Galleass of Malta in the Spanish ArmadaThis ship had 124 sailors, 50 artillery units, 300 sailors and 270 soldiers. &&&&& &&&&& It was built in Naples. It displaced 762 tones and was the largest ship and, according to some, the most splendid of the entire army. &&&&& &&&&& === Nautical Difficulties === &&&&& One of the most difficult variables that made navigating the British Channel so dangerous were (and still are) were the currents caused by the tides. Local pilots had good knowledge of those currents. &&&&& &&&&& === Battle actions === &&&&& &&&&& * According to various testimonials (documentaries and film documentaries), the San Lorenzo Galleass could not progress rowing against the current caused by the tide. &&&&& * The Duke of Medina Sidonia denied Hugo of Montcada permission to attack the Ark Royal ship, when she was within his reach and in conditions of superiority. &&&&& * San Lorenzo was the first ship that warned of the danger of the eight ships sent by Drake against the anchored Spanish navy . &&&&& * The order of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, to cut the chains of the anchors of all the ships of the army, caused chaos and many collisions between them. &&&&& &&&&& === Final disaster === &&&&& The references to the fact are numerous and not always coincident. &&&&& &&&&& In the confusion brought about by the collisions, a shock rendered unusable the rudder of San Lorenzo. The maneuver with the oars was not sufficiently agile to fight under the attack of the enemies (from the Ark Royal in particular). Hugo of Montcada decided to go to refuge in the port of Calais (under French control and, in theory, neutral). He did not reach the entrance by sailing and the oars, the Galleass tried to enter the port of Calais but bog down near the entrance. Being half lying sideways.The soldiers (probably terrified by the incident) deserted the ship, jumping to the water. Many of them were drowned.Only a few faithful remained aboard. &&&&& &&&&& The English, sent a few bots with soldiers to seize the galeass. Finally Howard sent a reinforcement with the Ark Royal's Panescalm boat and could reduce the last resistance. Hugo of Montcada was shot down with an arquebus shot in his head, and Joan Setantí and other Catalans defenders died as well. &&&&& &&&&& <!-- &&&&& &&&&& === News of the defeat and commentary on the Dietari of the Generalitat de Catalunya === &&&&& « &&&&& Tuesday, October 4, 1588, Saint Francis's Day: On this day came and published again as the army that his magistrate had done and sent to England also returned in Spain split by bad weather part in La Coruña and part in Laredo and Santander, it was very badly marinated due to bad weather and lack of provisions in the way if many people died, and among others lost a galease of which was captain Don Hugo de Moncada son of the account of Aytona which is stuck and the opposites fight With them, and Mr. Hugo and Joan Setanti and other cathalans, dying and fighting arms and hands like brave knights, are killed, so that they only fight and die in a cathalan fight and not another nation, God is all served and hated. &&&&& » &&&&& &&&&& - Manual of novice ardits: commonly called Diario del antich consell Barcelona. &&&&& &&&&& Tribute poem &&&&& A "romance" tribute to Hug de Montcada was published by the "bachelor of Borja" Pedro de Moncayo. 20 &&&&& &&&&& The first verses summarize quite well the cause of the unnecessary defeat. &&&&& &&&&& « &&&&& Broken the broken cape and mast, &&&&& overgrown the galley, &&&&& Useless your artillery &&&&& and that of the brave opponent. &&&&& Leaving your soldiers &&&&& They spit out on the water &&&&& at the sight of the French &&&&& They are defending the beach ... &&&&& &&&&& » &&&&& &&&&& - Romance , Pedro de Moncayo. &&&&& --> &&&&& Important testimonial &&&&& According to the work "Armada Invencible", by Cesáreo Fernández Duro, there is a description of the final attack and the death of Hugo of Montcada according to the statements of a slave of the Marquis de Santa Cruz (Volume I, page 118, document K.1467, item 18). &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Spanish Armada in Ireland &&&&& * List of Ships of the Spanish Armada &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * The Story of the Tobermory Spanish Galleon &&&&& * The Defeat of the Spanish Armada.

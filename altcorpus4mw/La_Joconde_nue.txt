La Joconde nue &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& :''Not to be confused with Monna Vanna (painting).'' &&&&& thumb &&&&& '''''La Joconde nue''''' or '''''Monna Vanna''''' is a 1514-1516 charcoal drawing with white highlights by the school of Leonardo da Vinci. It is a semi-nude portrait of a woman. The position of the subject's hands and body are almost identical to that of Leonardo's ''Mona Lisa'', leading some experts to suggest this work may be a preparatory drawing for the famous painting. These experts identify this as an exceptionally fine work by a left-handed master, leading to speculation that this is the work of Leonardo himself. It is now in the musée Condé. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

He also suggested that the show would take an "extended hiatus" in order to accommodate the cast's other projects. In late April, Kaitlin Olson confirmed ''Sunny''s extended hiatus ahead of the thirteenth season due to the cast's busy schedules. In August 2018, Rob McElhenney confirmed that Howerton is "in pretty much every episode" of the season. Howerton appeared in six of the season's ten episodes, but had no writing credits. &&&&& &&&&& Episodes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& The thirteenth season received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 7.8/10 based on 12 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "''It's Always Sunny''s winning formula keeps the laughs rolling and the stomachs turning in a thirteenth season that's topical, triumphant, and toxic in the best way." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Enchanted Treasures &&&&& Introduction &&&&& right &&&&& '''''Enchanted Treasures''''' is a 1981 fantasy role-playing game supplement published by Reilly Associates. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Enchanted Treasures'' is a description of 36 magic items usable in any fantasy role-playing game. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Lewis Pulsipher reviewed ''Enchanted Treasures'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 47. Pulsipher commented that "7,000 words for that price? No FRP supplemental material is ''that'' good. ''Enchanted Treasures'' would have been an excellent 4-5 page magazine article (with proper editing), but 4-5 pages is a small fraction of a ... magazine. It's terribly overpriced." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

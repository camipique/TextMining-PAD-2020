Ismat Beg &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Ismat Beg''' (; born January 1951) is a Pakistani mathematician and researcher. He is a professor at the Lahore School of Economics, Higher Education Commission Distinguished National Professor and an honorary full professor at the Mathematics Division of the Institute for Basic Research, Florida, US. &&&&& &&&&& Beg's scientific contributions cover a wide range of topics spanning fixed point theory and approximations, fuzzy sets and systems, artificial intelligence and multicriteria decision theory. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& &&&&& Ismat Beg was born in Mohri Sharif, in 1951 to a migrated Kashmiri family. He got his primary schooling in village school sitting under trees. In 1961 his father took him to Risalpur and he was sent to Sapper Boys High School, Risalpur Cantt. After passing Secondary School Certificate in 1966 he joined Zamindar College, Bhimber Road, Gujrat for Higher Secondary School Certificate and Bachelor of Science. He did his master's degree at Government College, Lahore (now Government College University (Lahore)). &&&&& &&&&& In 1977, Beg travelled to Romania on a scholarship which he applied and qualified. In 1977–78, Beg attended the West University of Timișoara for Romanian language and pre-doctoral courses and passed the PhD entrance exam for the University of Bucharest. He started his PhD in fall of 1978 under the supervision of academician . His area of research is ordered vector spaces and linear operators with specialization in integral representation of linear operators. He defended his thesis in December 1981 and degree was awarded in 1982. &&&&& &&&&& Academic career &&&&& Ismat Beg started teaching just after his PhD in 1982 and has served in &&&&& * Lahore School of Economics &&&&& * Lahore University of Management Sciences &&&&& * Kuwait University &&&&& * Quaid-i-Azam University &&&&& * International Centre for Theoretical Physics &&&&& * Pakistan Navy Engineering College &&&&& * Nankai University &&&&& * University of Central Punjab &&&&& &&&&& He has published research papers in the fields of mathematics, computer science, economics, game theory, engineering, decision theory and social sciences that have been well cited by other researchers.

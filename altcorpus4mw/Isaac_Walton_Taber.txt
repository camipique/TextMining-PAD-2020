He was also known as "Walton Taber." As his work was often credited to "I. W. Taber," he has been confused with the photographer Isaiah West Taber (1830-1912). &&&&& Will's rifle went off but without effect &&&&& Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Tabor was the third of four sons born to merchant Isaac W. Taber and Lydia (née Hart) Taber. He studied at the Cooper Union Art School and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy (1880-1881; 1893). He was known for his pen and ink work drawn from photographs; he is most well known for the 250 illustrations he created for the four-volume ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War.'' His illustrations were published in popular magazines including ''St. Nicholas'' and ''Century.'' He illustrated Rudyard Kipling's ''Captains Courageous,'' Frank T. Bullen's ''Cruise of the Cachalot,'' and the 1928 edition of Herman Melville's ''Moby Dick.'' &&&&& &&&&& Taber died in New York City on February 12, 1933. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External Links &&&&& * Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, 1887 Internet Archive &&&&& * Captains Courageous, 1899 Internet Archive &&&&& * The Cruise of the Cachalot, 1906 Internet Archive &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

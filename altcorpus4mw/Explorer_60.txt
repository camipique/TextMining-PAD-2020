313	Explorer_60
Explorer 60 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Explorer 60''', also called as '''SAGE''', '''Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment''' and '''AEM-2''' ('''Applications Explorer Mission 2'''), was a NASA scientific satellite launched on February 18, 1979, from Wallops Flight Facility board a Scout D rocket. &&&&& &&&&& Spacecraft and Mission &&&&& AEM-2/SAGE spacecraft. &&&&& Explorer 60 was developed and built at the Boeing Aerospace consisting of two distinct modules: the spacecraft base module and the instrument module. The base module is a small, hexagonal prism containing power, command, communications, data handling and attitude control subsystems to support the instrument module. The base module includes a PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) telemetry data system and a communications subsystem that makes use of a conical log spiral S-band antenna and two VHF antennas. &&&&& &&&&& The base module is spin-stabilized, with 3-axis stabilization provided by an active reaction wheel and a magnetic torquing system (the attitude determination hardware consists of 5 Adcole 2-axis DSS, 2 Hughes HS scanners, and a TAM). The required attitude determination accuracies are: roll 0.7°, pitch 0.5°, and yaw 2.0° in operational mode. A hydrazine orbit adjust system provides the capability to minimize orbit variations to assure adequate mapping by the on-board instrument. &&&&& &&&&& The spacecraft had a launch mass of . The base module (six-sided prism) had a height of 65 cm. The overall height of the spacecraft, including antenna, was . Power was provided by two solar panels and batteries. Explorer 60 experienced power problems after May 15, 1979. However, the spacecraft operations continued until November 19, 1981. The signal from the spacecraft was last received on January 7, 1982, when the battery failed. On April 11, 1989, the spacecraft decayed in the atmosphere. &&&&& &&&&& Explorer 60 detected and tracked also 5 volcanic eruption plumes that penetrated the stratosphere. It determined the amount of new material each volcano added to the stratosphere. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

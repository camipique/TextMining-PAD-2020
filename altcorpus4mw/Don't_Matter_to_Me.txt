Don't Matter to Me &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Don't Matter to Me'''" is a song by Canadian musician Drake featuring posthumous vocals from American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson, from Drake's fifth studio album ''Scorpion'' (2018). It was sent to British contemporary hit radio on July 6, 2018 as the album's fourth single. The song was set to be released to US rhythmic radio on July 10, 2018 alongside "In My Feelings". However, its release in the country was cancelled when Republic Records decided to solely push "In My Feelings" to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio stations in the US. Commercially, the song has reached #1 in Sweden as well as the top 10 in Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. &&&&& &&&&& Jackson's vocals were taken from part of an unreleased 1983 session between Jackson and Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka. The songs "Love Never Felt So Good" and "This Is It" also came from the same session. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& First worked on as a demo, Jackson recorded the vocals in a 1983 recording session with Paul Anka. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Brendan Klinkenberg of ''Rolling Stone'' said, "the song opens like most Drake songs, with gloomy, atmospheric synths and Drake singing sweetly to an ex-lover. Then Jackson comes in; even with some digital quivering added to his vocals, he's unmistakeable. While the "featuring Michael Jackson" billing would feel like an unnecessary flourish in almost any scenario, it's close to earned here." Larry Fitzmaurice of ''Entertainment Weekly'' thought "the song makes great melodic hay out of a headline-grabbing posthumous Michael Jackson feature." Roisin O'Connor of ''The Independent'' deemed it "hauntingly beautiful", however, she felt Jackson's voice "is controversially auto-tuned to the point that it sounds more like one of his biggest imitators, The Weeknd." ''NME''s Luke Morgan Britton described the song as "a clear-cut power move, rather than artistic posthumous collaboration," and considered it as an example of "cases of Drake doing things because he can, rather than because he should." ''The Hollywood Reporter''s Jonny Coleman felt the song "is as unsettling as a Tupac hologram, but ultimately not as offensive. It sounds like a Weeknd B-side but is weird enough to break up some of the exhaustion of listening to ''Scorpion'' in one sitting." Dean Van Nguyen of ''The Irish Times'' said, "Jackson's segment is lovely, his vocal loop floating over the warm ‘n’ woozy orchestration which comes off as a kind of downbeat version of "Liberian Girl". Unfortunately, Drake is the worst thing about the song, his depressed coos sounding formless and without conviction." &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& In the United Kingdom, "Don't Matter to Me" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart on the chart dated July 12, 2018, behind George Ezra's "Shotgun". It serves as Drake's 15th top-ten song and Michael Jackson's 44th top ten on the chart. &&&&& &&&&& In the United States, the song debuted at number nine on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it Drake's 31st top-ten song and Jackson's 30th top ten on the chart. It stands as Jackson's second posthumous top-ten entry, tying the peak of his duet with Justin Timberlake, "Love Never Felt So Good" (2014). &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& Credits adapted from the album's liner notes and Tidal. &&&&& * Noel Cadastre – recording &&&&& * Noah "40" Shebib – production, recording &&&&& * Noel "Gadget" Campbell – mixing &&&&& * Harley Arsenault – mixing assistance &&&&& * Greg Moffet – mixing assistance &&&&& * Ronald Moonoo – mixing assistance &&&&& * Michael Jackson – vocals &&&&& * Nineteen85 – production &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Weekly charts=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Australia Urban (ARIA) &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Greece International Digital Singles (IFPI) &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ireland (IRMA) &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Italy (FIMI) &&&&& &&&&& 23 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Singapore (RIAS) &&&&& &&&&& 6 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Spain (PROMUSICAE) &&&&& &&&&& 33 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Year-end charts=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Denmark (Tracklisten) &&&&& &&&&& 88 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) &&&&& &&&&& 98 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Certifications &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Release history &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Country &&&&& &&&&& Date &&&&& &&&&& Format &&&&& &&&&& Label(s) &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& United Kingdom &&&&& &&&&& July 6, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Contemporary hit radio &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& United States &&&&& &&&&& October 9, 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

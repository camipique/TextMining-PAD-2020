Liv Sansoz &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Liv Sansoz''' (born 12 February 1977) is a French base jumper and world champion (x2) rock and ice climber. She had a year off after a fall but returned and climbed every Alp over 4,000 metres. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Sansoz was born in Bourg-Saint-Maurice in 1977 and grew up in the alps where she discovered climbing. Her parents built her a climbing wall and by 16 she was in the French National team. &&&&& &&&&& She has twice been the world champion and she has won the World Cup three times. She lost her confidence for a year after she cracked a vertabrae in her neck after a 10-metre fall. This ended her competitive career but she regained her confidence to climb. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017 she set out to climb every Alpine summit over 4,000 metres in a year. By July she was suffering from sleep deprivation but she had climbed 48 peaks combining the descent with skiing and paragliding when it was possible. Sometimes she was waking at three in the morning and then climbing for over 12 hours in a day. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

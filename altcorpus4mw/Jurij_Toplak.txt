Jurij Toplak &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Jurij Toplak and Harvard University students in 2017 discussing Cuban revolution. &&&&& '''Jurij Toplak''' (born 1977) is a constitutional scholar and election law expert. He is a University Professor of Law at the University of Maribor. He serves as the co-chair of the International Association of Constitutional Law (IACL) Freedom of Expression research group. &&&&& &&&&& He received LL.M. degree at Central European University in Budapest under the mentorship of Michel Rosenfeld and Andras Sajó. His doctoral dissertation supervisor was Daniel H. Lowenstein. &&&&& &&&&& He was a member of the National Election Commission of Slovenia from 2000 until 2012. Since 2006, he has been a board member, and he is a vice-chair of International Political Science Association Political Finance and Political Corruption Research Committee. At the age of 23 he published his first book on redistricting, for which Slovenian Lawyers’ Association awarded him with a “Young Lawyer of the Year” award. In 2006 he published (together with Klemen Jaklic, then a lecturer at Harvard), the first translation of United States Constitution in Slovenian language. Together with Daniel Smilov, he co-edited a book ''Political Finance and Political Corruption in Eastern Europe'' (Ashgate, 2007). He classified preferential voting electoral systems. Pippa Norris and Bernard Grofman are among those who referred to his works, and he is among the top ten most cited Slovenian legal scholars. &&&&& &&&&& As a consultant to governments or international organisations OSCE, European Union, Council of Europe, Greco, and UNDP he worked in Uganda, Canada, United States, France, Finland, Latvia, Monaco, Serbia, Montenegro, Malta, Ukraine, Romania and elsewhere. &&&&& &&&&& Jure Toplak led several successful impact litigation projects and wrote complaints and appeals to Slovenian Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, which improved human rights protection of disabled persons, candidates and voters. Based on the constitutional appeal he wrote for a group of paraplegics, the Constitutional Court ruled in 2010 that “as many as possible” polling stations need to be wheelchair accessible. Next year he wrote another appeal for three wheelchair-bound persons, and in 2014 the Constitutional Court annulled part of the election law and ruled that all polling stations must be accessible for persons with disabilities. In 2014, after two years of litigation for access to information, he obtained statistical data on schools and published it, which triggered a heated public debate. Toplak had long publicly opposed punishing of Internet users who discussed election candidates during the electoral silence. In 2011, he wrote two successful appeals for such Facebook users. After the 2014 elections, he wrote an appeal to the Supreme Court for a voter, who was fined 100 euros for publishing a comment on Facebook on a day before elections. In September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the fine and ruled that comments and discussions are not within a definition of illegal propaganda. In 2015, when the Constitutional Court was deciding whether the parliamentary seat of a parliamentarian due to his conviction was constitutional or not, the court copied arguments from Toplak's Amicus Curiae brief. During the 2018 parliamentary election, he helped a Green Party candidate list rejected by the election commissions and the Supreme Court returned it on the ballot. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, Jurij Toplak wrote a challenge to the referendum results for a voter and activist Vili Kovačič, which led to the first-ever public hearing by the Supreme Court of Slovenia and first-ever annulment of referendum results on 14 March 2018. On the same day Prime Minister Miro Cerar resigned. A minute later, a leading television program Pop TV, which broadcast the resignation, referred to Jurij Toplak as “the silent winner of the court ruling.” Slovenian lawyers voted Jurij Toplak among 'Ten most influential lawyers in Slovenia' in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

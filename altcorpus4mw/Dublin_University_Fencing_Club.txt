Dublin University Fencing Club &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Dublin University Fencing Club (DUFC)''' is the fencing club of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, located in Dublin, Ireland. The club caters for foil, épée and sabre. Its members are students, alumni and staff from Trinity College with a small amount of visiting fencers from other clubs. &&&&& &&&&& Early history &&&&& In 1730, a group of students from Trinity College formed a ''Gentleman's Club of the Sword'', or the ''Gentleman's Society of the Sword'' as it has also been called. This club, while initially hugely popular fell out of use by the last quarter of the 18th century. In 1774, Provost John Hely-Hutchinson formally established fencing in Trinity by employing a fencing-master and designating the Senate House specifically for this purpose. With the further decline of duelling throughout the 18th and no record of the club throughout the 19th century, it is not until the formation of the modern D.U. Fencing Club in 1936 that the sport was reestablished in the college. &&&&& &&&&& Present status &&&&& &&&&& Since its foundation, DUFC has grown vastly. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, membership was about fifty fencers in general with an Intervarsities team of 8. In contrast, the 2009/2010 season saw intake of approximately 300 new members with an Intervarsities contingent of 24 competing, with similar numbers maintained in the club since. &&&&& &&&&& The club's most decorated coach, Professor Patrick Duffy, coached the club from 1952 until 1987. Following his death in 1987, ''The Professor Duffy Memorial Team Épée'' tournament was inaugurated by D.U.Fencing Club. This competition is still run today and attracts teams from Germany, Italy and the U.K. regularly. &&&&& &&&&& The club has maintained its status as a centre of excellence, consistently ranking at the top of the national club medal table in Ireland. During the 2017/18 season, Dublin University Fencing Club became part of the ''Trinity Sport high performance programme,'' giving its first team access to additional strength and conditioning coaching, physiotherapy, anti-doping and nutritional expertise. &&&&& &&&&& Notable alumni &&&&& Since the formation of the modern club, a number of members have gone on to represent the club and their country in both fencing and the modern pentathlon.

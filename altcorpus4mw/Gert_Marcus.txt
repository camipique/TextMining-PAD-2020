1114	Gert_Marcus
Gert Marcus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Di-eder'', on Sergels Torg in Stockholm (Åke Sandström) &&&&& '''Gert Olof Marcus''' was a Swedish painter and sculptor. He was born 10 November 1914 in the Groß Borstel district of Hamburg and died in Stockholm on 23 December 2008. &&&&& &&&&& Marcus’ father was a German lawyer named Paul Marcus but his mother, Hilda Maria Dahl, was Swedish. The couple had four children: Ingolf, Gert, Holger and Anna Britta. Paul was of Jewish descent so, with the rise of Nazism, the family had to flee Germany. Ingolf, who was at that time a young pianist, had already moved to Zurich, where he later began a career as a conductor and composer. In 1939, he moved to Los Angeles and took his mother's maiden name, Dahl. Gert Marcus and his brother Holger moved to Sweden in 1933; other family members joined them there. &&&&& &&&&& ''The Sequence of Di-eder'', in Lindholmen in Göteborg (Hans Wretling) &&&&& Apart from a few months studying at the Otte Skölds målarskola (1936–37) and some months at the Ateneum School in Helsinki, Finland (1937–1938), Gert Marcus was an autodidact. He became one of Sweden's most consistent concretists, even if he distanced himself from all "isms". Marcus lived most of his life in Stockholm but he worked for long periods in France in Menton, L’Esconil (Brittany) and Paris, and in Italy at Massa-Carrara. &&&&& &&&&& Early in his life he was influenced by Paul Cézannes attempts in determining how to create space and volume without the use of Renaissance perspective. This led to Marcus’ creating a color theory – which he was faithful to during his entire artistic career. Work on volume and color opened for him a road to bas-reliefs and eventually to sculpture. In 1955 he met the artists Michel Seuphor, Nicolas Schöffer, and Georges Vantongerloo in Paris. With the last, Marcus developed a long and profitable friendship. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1950s, Gert Marcus was awarded several commissions, including that for a wall mosaic in Sankt Mikaels kapell in Mora in 1954, another mosaic in Stockholm's polishus in 1957, a choir wall in the church of Vantör in Stockholm, and a wall mosaic in finely crushed glass in Sergelteatern in 1959. Marcus was frequently commissioned to provide sculptural monuments in public spaces in Sweden and even to design the interior of the Bagarmossen metro station in Stockholm. &&&&& &&&&& In 1999 Gert Marcus was awarded the Prince Eugen medal by the King of Sweden for "outstanding artistic achievement." &&&&& &&&&& ''Body and Line'', in Lund (Gert Marcus) &&&&& Marcus married twice, first to Anne-Marie Söderlund, a marriage that lasted from 1945 to 1970 and produced two children, Anna and Claude and then, in 1977, to fellow sculptor Françoise Ribeyrolles-Marcus, with whom he fathered a second daughter, Aurelia. &&&&& &&&&& The "Initiative Marcus und Dahl" &&&&& In 2017 residents of Gross-Borstel founded a new society, "Initiative Marcus und Dahl",– with the goal of reviving interest in the work of Gert Marcus and Ingolf Dahl as well as other artists living or working, or having lived or worked, in Gross-Borstel. &&&&& &&&&& Works by Gert Marcus &&&&& *"Rymdkors vägg", sgraffito, Sankt Mikael Chapel in Mora (Sweden), 1954 &&&&& *Wall in stone mosaic, east entrance hall at the Police Headquarters, Stockholm (Sweden), 1957 &&&&& *"Korsmosaik", Vantör Church, Stockholm, 1958–59 &&&&& *"Homage till Harpo Marx", mosaic of finely crushed glass, foyer of the Sergel Theatre, Stockholm, 1959.

229	Drumquhassle
Drumquhassle &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Drumquhassle''' was a Roman fort associated with the Gask Ridge in Scotland. It was found from aerial photography in the late 1970s. The name selected for the fort deliberately made it hard for English born readers to pronounce. The fort was from the Flavian period; it was built and briefly occupied by during the administration of Sallustius Lucullus. It is known as a "Glen-blocker" fort and is located within sight of Loch Lomond. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& The fort is located in Stirling, east of Drymen. It is associated with the road running from Loudoun Hill past Barochan towards Malling, Bochastle and Dalginross. This road was therefore on the Highland Boundary Fault Frontier. &&&&& &&&&& It may have been on more than one Roman road. It has been suggested that Drumquhassle might be connected to Doune via the Fords of Frew. &&&&& &&&&& The glebblocker forts ran from Drumquhassle to Stracathro. The fort is about 50 m west of a reliable spring which was presumably the soldiers' main water source. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Finds &&&&& A enamelled broach was found as well as some sling bullets. Pottery from Gaul known as Terra Nigra was also recovered. Several coins were also found. &&&&& &&&&& Forts and ''Fortlets'' associated with the Gask Ridge from south to north Balmuildy, Cadder, Castlecary, Mumrills, Camelon, Drumquhassle, Malling, Doune, ''Glenbank'', Bochastle, Ardoch, ''Sheilhill'', Strageath, Dalginross, ''Midgate'', Bertha, Fendoch, Cargill, Cardean, '''Inchtuthil''', ''Inverquharity'', Stracathro &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

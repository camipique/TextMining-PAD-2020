HNK Tomislav &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Hrvatski nogometni klub Tomislav''' (Croatian Football Club Tomislav) is a professional football club from Tomislavgrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club plays in the Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& === Kingdom of Yugoslavia === &&&&& &&&&& Tomislavgrad's football history starts in 1910, when August Batinić, a player of the NK SAŠK, brought a ball in Tomislavgrad, at the time named Županjac. The first football matches were played at Bara, where the present-day basilica is located. &&&&& &&&&& The first idea to found a football club in Županjac occurred after the World War I. However, the founding assembly was held only on 30 April 1920 in a pub owned by Ilija Zrno Čokrlja. The initiator of the idea was August Batinić. The first president of the football club's committee was Stojan Protrka. The committee named the football club HNK Tomislav in honour of the first Croatian king Tomislav, whose crowning took place near Županjac and preparations were under way to mark a 1000-year jubilee of the event. The first kit, a white shirt and black trousers, in which footballers played before the World War I, were confirmed by the committee as the official kit. &&&&& &&&&& Construction of a playground was among the main goals of the committee, however, it wasn't realised. The club player on various improvised playgrounds. The first match played by the clup was held in Županjac on 29 September 1920 against students from Županjac who studied at the Široki Brijeg gymnasium. Tomislav won the match. The first official match was played against Stožer, won by Tomislav 2-1. &&&&& &&&&& In 1925, Županjac changed its name to Tomislavgrad, officially in honour of Prince Tomislav, son of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, but unofficially in honour of King Tomislav of Croatia. Due to official state policy of Kingdom of Yugoslavia which suppressed Croatian nationalism, in 1927 the club was renamed to Vran (after the Vran mountain), a name that was used until 1946, so it could continue to play against other football clubs. &&&&& &&&&& === Communist Yugoslavia === &&&&& &&&&& During the World War II, Tomislavgrad was part of the German puppet-state Independent State of Croatia, which was divided into two demarcation zones, one occupied by Germans and other by Italians. Tomislavgrad was in the Italian zone. During the war, Vran played matches against the Italian regiments. &&&&& &&&&& After the World War II, the communists took power. In accordance with the socialist ideology, Vran changed its name to Zvijezda (Star). This was club's name from 1946 to 1954. The official kit was a red shirt and blue trousers and socks. Zvijezda didn't participate at the official contests, but it did played against neighbouring football clubs. In 1952, Zvijezda played in the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar. &&&&& &&&&& Zvijezda again changed its name on 23 August 1954 to Fudbalski klub Budućnost (Football Club Future). The club used this name until 1990. The Budućnost's colours were red and white. Budućnost continued to play in the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar. The League had 10 clubs. The official playground of Budućnost was now near the town's centre. &&&&& &&&&& In 1958 the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar was divided into two groups - North and South, each had 6 clubs. Budućnost was in the group North. The group North had six clubs. Budućnost ended up fourth. &&&&& &&&&& On the initiative of the sportsmen from Livno, the Football Sub-Federation Livno was formed. The Football Sub-Federation Livno existed from 1959 to 1963. It had 6 clubs. In order to maintain the Sub-Federation Livno, new clubs were formed. Budućnost competed in the Sub-Federation Livno until 1962. &&&&& &&&&& As a factory was being constructed at the Budućnost's playground, Budućnost played on an improvised playground at Glibine in Ćavarov Stan. In May 1960 the Sub-Federation Livno suspended Budućnost and the suspension was lifted in December 1960. Budućnost was suspended because the Sub-Federation Livno intended to make Troglav a champion, and first place was held by Budućnost. Nonetheless, Budućnost ended up first, and entered the Herzegovina Zone, part of the Third Yugoslav League. Budućnost ended up 11th out of 12 clubs and continued to compete in the Herzegovina Zone. &&&&& &&&&& In 1963 Budućnost gained a new stadium named Ferovac, which serves as the official stadium for HNK Tomislav today. The stadium had stands and locker rooms. In average, Budućnost was at the centre of the rankings or was competing to remain in the Third League. As of season 1971-72 to 1974-75, Budućnost was at among the top clubs of the Third League. &&&&& &&&&& In 1978 the Herzegovina Zone was divided into two groups. The division was made because many new clubs were founded in Herzegovina. Budućnost was in the grup amongst ten other clubs. Budućnost won the third place. &&&&& &&&&& In 1979, the new Republican Regional League - South was formed and Budućnost managed to enter the newly formed league and played in it through the 1979-80 season. &&&&& &&&&& In the season of 1981-82 Budućnost was again back in the Herzegovina Zone - South. In 1984 it was decided to unite the North and South groups into one league with 18 clubs, among which was Budućnost which ended up 13th. &&&&& &&&&& === Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In 1989 Fudbalski klub Budućnost changed its name to Nogometni klub Budućnost, using the Croatian term for football instead of the official Serbo-Croatian. On 30 May 1990, Budućnost took its original name HNK Tomislav. The official stadium was named Gradski stadion "Tomislav" (City Staium "Tomislav"). &&&&& &&&&& In the season of 1990-91 Tomislav played in the Herzegovina Zone - South, and took the first place and entered the Republican Regional League - South. In 1991 Tomislav was successful in the Coup of Yugoslavia entering the round of 16 where it was defeated by RAD from Belgrade with a result of 0-4. &&&&& &&&&& Tomislav played three matches in the Republican Regional League - South in total, and refused to continue to compete after that due to political reasons, namely protesting against the war in Croatia. After Tomislav left the League, other Croatian clubs did so as well. &&&&& &&&&& During the Bosnian War, all players of the Tomislav participated either as soldiers or in working units. Tomislav continued to exist despite the war. In August 1992 it played a tournament against the units of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).

Each national league had its own football federation and national team. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1993–94 season Tomislav was a runner-up, while Široki Brijeg won the championship of the Herzegovina group of the First League. Both clubs had the same number of points and the same goal difference, but Široki Brijeg was better in matches between the respective clubs. Thus, Široki Brijeg gained the right to play-off with the champions from the Posavina and Central Bosnia groups, eventually defeating them becoming the champion of Herzeg-Bosnia. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1994–95 season Tomislav took the 4th place. In the 1995-96 season, 80% of players were recruited, but nonetheless Tomislav managed to perform well. In the 1996–97 season, Tomislav was demoted to the Second League of Herzeg-Bosnia.

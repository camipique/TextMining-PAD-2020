Empath (album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Empath''''' is the eighteenth studio album by Canadian metal musician Devin Townsend, released on his own label HevyDevy Records on March 29, 2019. It is his first solo album since ''Dark Matters'', which was a part of the 2014 double album ''Z²'', and his first release to act solely as a solo album since 2007's ''Ziltoid the Omniscient''. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& On January 31, 2018, Townsend announced on his Facebook page that he was taking a break from the Devin Townsend Project, which had been his main project since 2008, although 2014 saw the release of both ''Z²'', a dual release acting as both a solo album and a Devin Townsend Project album, and ''Casualties of Cool'', by Townsend's eponymous country rock duo; this made ''Empath'' Townsend's first release to act solely as a solo album since ''Ziltoid the Omniscient'' in 2007, and the first not to be a concept album since his 2006 ambient album ''The Hummer''. &&&&& &&&&& Townsend first mentioned ''Empath'' in a tweet from January 1, 2017.

This is a statement about not only pursuing creative freedom in a conservative scene, but also trying to show that heavy music is truly a valid musical tool." Guest performers include former Frank Zappa collaborators Mike Keneally, Morgan Ågren and Steve Vai, as well as Samus Paulicelli from Decrepit Birth, Anup Sastry, Chad Kroeger, Townsend's regular collaborator Anneke van Giersbergen, Ché Aimee Dorval (who had worked with Townsend on ''Casualties of Cool''), and Ryan Dahle. &&&&& &&&&& A series of documentary videos detailing the making of ''Empath'' has been released on YouTube. &&&&& &&&&& On February 22, 2019, the first single from the album, "Genesis", was released. A corresponding video was also debuted that complemented the song's intricate style. On March 15, 2019, a second single titled "Evermore" was released with an accompanying video. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& ''Empath'' was released on March 29, 2019.

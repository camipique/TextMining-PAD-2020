Reese''' is the founder, chairman and CEO of TigerSwan, a global risk management consultancy founded in 2008. Prior to founding TigerSwan, Reese served in the elite Delta Force military unit for 25 years. He was interviewed in 2013 by Dan Rather and he is a Fox News channel contributor. &&&&& &&&&& According to the ''Washington Free Beacon'', "Famed Delta officer Tom Greer described Reese this way: "Reese, a stand-out Ranger and Delta officer, quite possibly would have made General Grant appear wanting when it came to working through chaos, calming nerves, and demanding the best out of subordinates."" &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& === Military === &&&&& Jim Reese is a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army. He served with the Army's most elite special operations force, Delta Force, as a troop commander, squadron operations officer, and as his unit's operations officer. He also later served as a task force operations officer, chief of staff, and commander within the deployed combat elements of the Joint Special Operations Command. &&&&& &&&&& Reese retired from the military as a Lt. Colonel in 2007 after 25 years of service. He was a decorated combat leader in the Army's Delta Force, a special operations unit. When he retired, the Commander of the Coalition Forces of Iraq and Afghanistan, General David McKiernan, called Reese "one of the finest special operators in the modern military." &&&&& &&&&& In 2007, after serving as both a non-commissioned officer and commissioned officer, Reese retired from the U.S. Army, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, known as the "Delta Force." During his time as a commander, Reese became a decorated combat leader. &&&&& &&&&& During the Iraq War, Reese served as the commander of a task force that hunted terrorists from groups such as al Qaeda. According to ''The Washington Examiner'', "...within the special operations community, Reese's reputation is legendary. Distinguished former Delta operator Dalton Fury once argued that Reese "quite possibly would have made Ulysses S. Grant appear wanting when it came to working through chaos, calming nerves, and demanding the best out of subordinates."" &&&&& &&&&& === TigerSwan === &&&&& &&&&& During a cold-weather training mission in Colorado, Reese came up with the idea for TigerSwan. The company is a global risk management organization that conducts operations in over 50 countries. Its primary clients are government agencies, businesses, and individuals. &&&&& &&&&& TigerSwan is also a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. &&&&& &&&&& Reese is responsible for growing TigerSwan into a leader in the global risk management and mitigation consultancy. "He has done so through the development and implementation of innovative ideas in the protection of materials, personnel, infrastructure, equipment and brand." &&&&& &&&&& Dan Rather visited Reese in 2013 on ''Dan Rather Reports'' to learn about the roles Special Operations play in modern-day warfare. Reese trains law enforcement and military personnel at TigerSwan, in addition to running the company's security consultancy practice. &&&&& &&&&& === Media === &&&&& Reese became a Fox News contributor in June 2018. In his debut appearance, he appeared on ''Fox & Friends'' to discuss a proposed timeline for North Korea to meet U.S. demands, following President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He said, “This isn’t just a U.S. timeline; this is a negotiated settlement for the Korean peninsula.” He criticized the two-and-a-half year timeline for coinciding with President Trump’s first term in office and re-election. &&&&& &&&&& On May 16, 2017, ''The Washington Examiner'' published an opinion article titled "Why Jim Reese should be the next FBI director." The author wrote:He is not just any mentor. Reese has no qualms issuing challenge alongside praise. He tells you when he believes you're wrong. He believes that success requires a fidelity to introspection and durable outcomes. That characteristic of fidelity offers the first reason why Reese would be a great pick for the FBI. He is a leader who would not buckle under political pressure, nor yield to public expectation. He would use his office to advance the FBI's mission rather than his own persona. &&&&& &&&&& === Personal Life === &&&&& Reese was born in Panama (Panama Canal Zone), is married to Niki Reese (Norton) and he has two children. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Bloomberg profile &&&&& * Dan Rather Interviews James Reese - YouTube &&&&& * James Reese TigerSwan: Levels of Awareness - Slideshare &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Lomodo IVa &&&&& Introduction &&&&& right &&&&& '''''Lomodo IVa''''' is a 1981 role-playing game supplement for ''Traveller'' published by Group One. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Lomodo IVa'' is an adventure setting describing the planet Lomoda IVa, a world on which two intelligent races have died off, leaving the planet in the possession of a semi-intelligent jellyfish-like species, the Osp. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& William A. Barton reviewed ''Lomodo IVa'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 48. Barton commented that "All in all, ''Lomodo IVa'', while having its points of interest, seems the least inspired of any of Group One's adventures thus far. If you haven't thought much of their past products, you'll really hate this one. Unless you're a collector of all ''Traveller'' items or are hard up for a place to adventure, pass this one by." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

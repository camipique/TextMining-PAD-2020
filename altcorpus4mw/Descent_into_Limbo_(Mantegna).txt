It depicts the Descent into Limbo of Jesus Christ. There are also drawings of the subject by Mantegna in the École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, whilst Giovanni Bellini also painted the subject. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& File:LimbesMantegnaLignes.jpg|Geometric scheme of the composition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Missing part &&&&& Studies for the catalogue ''Accademia Carrara, Bergamo Dipinti Italiani del Trecento e del Quattrocento'' (edited by Giovanni Valagussa), included a painting owned by the Accademia Carrara (Bergamo) from 1866. It had formerly been considered to be a studio work, under the title ''Resurrection''. During the studies it was re-identified as the upper part of ''Descent into Limbo'', thanks to a small cross divided between the two parts. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& File:MantegnaDescentLimbo (complete).jpg|The whole work &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Tatjana Pauli, ''Mantegna'', serie ''Art Book'', Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

The ship remained lodged on the shoal, where it eventually broke apart. &&&&& &&&&& Following the loss of ''Faithful Stewart'', the beach near where the ship was wrecked became known as coin beach due to the large number of copper coins that would wash ashore during storms. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

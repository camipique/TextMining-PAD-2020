823	Indian_armour
Indian armour &&&&& Introduction &&&&& An early 18th century Maratha helmet and armour from the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia. &&&&& Armour in the Indian subcontinent was used since antiquity. Its earlier reference is found in the vedic period. Armor has been described in religious texts; including the Itihasa epics Ramayana and Mahabharat, as well as in the Puranas. &&&&& &&&&& [[Vedic period]] &&&&& Defensive armor was introduced into India by Indo-Aryan peoples, and was most likely unknown to the passive Indus Valley Civilisation. &&&&& &&&&& Armor was first mentioned in the Rigveda: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Vedic soldiers in 1500 BC wore armor called '''varman.''' Edward Washburn Hopkins says that the armor was metal covered the shoulders and was connected by wires. On the head multiple metal pieces were connected together for helmets. &&&&& &&&&& According to R.S. Sharma india's ancient past during the vedic period 1500 BC - 1000 BC, the warriors of the vedic society wore mail armour along with bronze helmets. However no such archeological evidence was found. &&&&& &&&&& === Mythological armour === &&&&& In Mahabharata, there are much evidence of using armour during the battles. &&&&& &&&&& ;'''Kavacha''' &&&&& * '''Karna Kavacha''' - The armour of Karna that was granted by his father Surya at birth. It was impenetrable even to heavenly weapons. &&&&& * '''Shiva-Kavacha''' - The armour of Lord Shiva which will make its wielder invincible. &&&&& ;'''Khetaka''' &&&&& * '''Jaivardhan''' - A shield of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. &&&&& * The shield of Shamba. &&&&& * Srivatsa - The shield of Vishnu, a symbol worshiped and revered by the Hindus, said to be manifested on the god's chest. &&&&& &&&&& Antiquity &&&&& Kumara/Kartikeya in scale mail armour with a Kushan devotee, 2nd century CE &&&&& Armor is discussed in Chanakya's ''Arthashastra'' (320 BCE). &&&&& &&&&& The Kingdom of Magadha rapidly expanded its military infrastructure under King Ajatashatru, creating the foundation of later empires in Pataliputra. He introduced the ''rathamusala'', an armored chariot with protruding blades. &&&&& &&&&& The Bharhut Stupa depicts the use of leather scale armour. Furthermore on the Sanchi Stupa, soldiers are depicted wearing quilted armor. &&&&& &&&&& There are references by historians noting the armor King Porus used in battle against Alexander. The scholar Arrian recorded that the armour was shot-proof, and remarkably well fitted. &&&&& &&&&& Gupta period &&&&& Gupta era soldier in scale armour. &&&&& During the Gupta period scale mail armour used as composed of metal and sometimes leather. Guptas were more than two centuries more advanced than the equipment and technology being depicted here and that their armour was built to withstand torsion-driven steel bows. Siva-Dhanur-Veda discusses the military of the Gupta Empire. The Guptas relied heavily on armoured war elephants; horses were used little if at all. The use of chariots had declined heavily by the time of the Guptas, as they had not proved very useful against the Greeks, Scythians, and other invaders. Guptas utilised heavy cavalry clad in mail armour and equipped with maces and lances, who would have used shock action to break the enemy line. &&&&& &&&&& During the Satavahana period the armour was inspired by the armour used by the Indo-Scythians and the Alchon Huns. &&&&& &&&&& Medieval period &&&&& Group of Indian Armor. &&&&& &&&&& === Early Medieval period (1206 CE-1526 CE) === &&&&& During 12th century chainmail armour is first introduced in the Indian subcontinent and used by Turkic armies. An reference of chainmail armour was found in the inscription of Mularaja II and also at the Battle of Delhi where it was used by the armoured war elephants &&&&& &&&&& === Later Medival period (1526 CE-1757 CE) === &&&&& &&&&& ===Mughal armour === &&&&& In 16th century the armour in the Indian subcontinent developed very much. Armour such as chainmail and scale mail are widely used by the Mughals. The use of armour continues until the Battle of Plassey in 1757. &&&&& &&&&& ===Mughal helmets=== &&&&& Despite the similarity in their design, the Khula Khud helmets were decorated with a wide degree of variations depending on the cultures from which they were created. Decorations often appeared in the skull and the nasal bar, which were often heavily decorated with patterned motifs of inlaid brass, silver or gold; or decorated with figurative images. One Mughal top helmet featured calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran, supposedly to gain "Help from Allah and a speedy victory." A top discovered in Gwalior, India, featured a motif of the skull and crossbones sign of European influence. Another part of the Khula Khud helmet that was often a focus of artistic decoration, was the leaf-shaped finials of the nasal bar. A Sikh top featured the figure of Ganesha carved onto the nasal bar. The Khula Khud helmet was only decorated with some metals, and usually no organic decorations. &&&&& &&&&& ===Maratha armour=== &&&&& Maratha armour is very similar to the Mughal armour but in the Maratha army, the infantry used armor while the cavalry is always lightly armour, such as the leather armor. Maratha armour is mostly inspired by the Mughal armour. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * Roy, Kaushik.

When Xiao Ming was young, he and his grandmother ate San Xian noodles from a local noodle shop that to him showed care and effort for their food. However, the shop closed down with speculation that the owners were pushed out due to jealousy or a client wanted them back in Beijing. Xiao Ming then went to another noodle shop in his town, and although the shop buys pre-made San Xian noodles, the noodle soup had many toppings much to Xiao Ming's satisfaction. Later, the husband of the owner of that noodle shop wanted the noodle shop to become a fishing shop. After bad business and an incident involving the couple's son, the noodle shop reopened with the husband and son of the owner working as well. Years later in Beijing, Xiao Ming went to a noodle shop that sold San Xian noodles that had fewer toppings and a higher price, which dissatisfied Xiao Ming. He later heard news back in Hunan that his grandmother was dying and came back as soon as possible. Xiao Ming finally met his grandmother at his home minutes before her death and grieved. Xiao Ming later came back to the noodle shop in his town, and through its San Xian noodles, felt nostalgic of his times with his grandmother and was content with the future that was ahead of him. &&&&& &&&&& === Chiisana Fashion Show (''A Little Fashion Show'') === &&&&& Taking place in Guangzhou, Yi Lin is a fashion model and her younger sister Lulu is a student in designing clothes.

Yi Lin, to compensate for this, exercised a great deal to look more attractive, though this became overbearing for her and she fainted in the upcoming fashion show. Yi Lin, seeing no purpose in continuing her career in the fashion industry, asked Lulu to help her learn how to design and sew clothes, triggering an argument between the two sisters. Yi Lin explained to her manager about her situation, and her manager gave her a slip to meet up at a place. Yi Lin comes to the place, which turns out to be an abandoned factory, and receives a surprise encounter from Lulu.

Xiao Yu later responds back to Li Mo in cassette tapes and the two develop a romantic relationship with each other. Soon, Xiao Yu told Li Mo that her family is making her apply to an elite university far away and that they would have to move away, angering Li Mo. Li Mo later decided to apply to the same university, though the academic gap between Li Mo and Xiao Yu was large. Li Mo, through hard work and a studious behavior, got accepted into the university, and when he went to Xiao Yu's apartment to tell the news, he learned that Xiao Yu is in the hospital after her father beat her for failing the application test. Li Mo did not get to see the chance to see her since his family had to move away to live close to the university.

Lincoln Yards Stadium &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lincoln Yards Stadium''' was the working name for a planned 20,000-seat soccer stadium to house the future Chicago team in the USL Championship. &&&&& &&&&& Plans for the stadium, which was to sit on the west side of the North branch of the Chicago River, include a retractable roof in order to host other sporting, entertainment and cultural events. The stadium would be part of a massive $5 billion, 70-acre mixed-use development project, to include apartments, condos, office, retail and entertainment. The development was also a proposed site in Chicago's unsuccessful bid for Amazon's second headquarters. &&&&& &&&&& In January 2019, plans for the stadium were dropped after not receiving political support. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * Chicago USL website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

The population of Linz increased from 112,000 inhabitants in 1938 to just under 200,000 in 1945. At the same time 11,000 new apartments were built. For the construction work also forced laborers and prisoners of war were consulted and the material in the KZ-Mauthausen and subcamps. &&&&& &&&&& Large courtyards with green areas are typical of the Hitler Buildings. In addition to the large housing blocks for the workers, which are architecturally the Heimatschutz architecture based on the shape of Upper Austrian square farmstead (Vierkanthof), also single and multi-family houses for senior employees, officers, etc. were built in settlements. The unfinished or war-damaged buildings were completed after the war. &&&&& &&&&& The general planning was largely the responsibility of the architect Roderich Fick. The buildings were executed by various planners, such as Armin Sturmberger, Fritz Fanta, Herbert Rimpl and Hans Arndt as well as by Roderich Fick himself Buildings are listed buildings. &&&&& &&&&& Examples &&&&& &&&&& Linz Harbachsiedlung 02.jpg|Harbachsiedlung, Linz &&&&& Gründberg-Siedlung III.jpg|Gründbergsiedlung, Linz &&&&& Karlhofsiedlung I.jpg|Karlhof, Linz &&&&& Aubergsiedlung II.jpg|Auberg, Linz &&&&& Auhofsiedlung III.jpg|Auhof, Linz &&&&& Schörgenhubsiedlung II.jpg|Neue Heimat, Linz &&&&& Kleinmünchen V.jpg|Kleinmünchen, Linz &&&&& Leo-Gabler-Strasse in Muenichholz.jpg|Münichholz, Steyr &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Sylvia Necker, Elisabeth Kramer: ''„Hitlerbauten“ in Linz.

Gwen Alston &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Hannah Gwendolen Shone''' (22 May 1907 â€“ 14 July 1993) was a British aerodynamicist and educationalist most known for her work on spinning tunnels and aircraft flight-testing during World War II, as well as her involvement in flight education. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Alston was born on 22 May 1907 in Birkenhead, Cheshire. She was educated at Wallasey High School and Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay. She obtained a BSc in mathematics in 1927 and a diploma in education in 1928, both from the University of Liverpool. While at university she took flying lessons and obtained her private pilot's 'A' flying licence in 1929 before spending five years teaching mathematics in Rotherham and Nottingham, and simultaneously working towards a MSc in aerodynamics at the University of Nottingham, which she was awarded in 1932. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& === Research === &&&&& &&&&& Alston joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield in 1933, working under Hermann Glauert and supervising the local spinning tunnel. &&&&& &&&&& During World War II, she investigated the cause of Fairey Barracuda torpedo bomber accidents. Together with her pilot Eric Brown, she carried out test flights and found problems with flap positions in conjunction with rudder input to be the cause of the crashes. &&&&& &&&&& She was a founding member of RAF technical flight, the Aerospace Education and Recreation Organisation and became and associate of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1956. &&&&& &&&&& Alston retired in 1973. &&&&& &&&&& === Teaching === &&&&& After graduating from the University of Liverpool, Alston taught mathematics in Rotherham and Nottingham from 1929 to 1934 while completing her Master's degree. &&&&& &&&&& Throughout her consequent scientific career, Alston committed herself to the improvement and communication of aviation education. In 1947 she was appointed to Inspector of Schools in England. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life and family &&&&& Alston was an avid aviator, obtaining her flying license from the Royal Aero Club in 1929 and completing basic and advanced RAF pilot training. &&&&& &&&&& In 1933, Alston met her future husband Peter Alston, a Civilian Scientific Officer, who died on the 16th of February 1939 near Eyke, Suffolk, while testing a military aircraft. The Royal Aeronautical Society's RP Alston Medal was first awarded in 1949 in memory of Alston's late husband. &&&&& &&&&& Awards and honours &&&&& &&&&& * In 1969, Alston became the first recipient of the Scott-Farnie Medal for her contribution to aviation education. &&&&& * In 1970, Alston became an Honorary Companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

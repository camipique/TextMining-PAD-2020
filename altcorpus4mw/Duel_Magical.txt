Duel Magical &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''''Duel Magical''''' is a 1982 board game published by Ragnarok Enterprises. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& ''Duel Magical'' is a game designed by Dave Nalle involving conflict between mages in an arena. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Ronald Pehr reviewed ''Duel Magical'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 51. Pehr commented that "''Duel Magical'' is too abstract and simple to suit most gamers; repeated playings will tarnish the novelty. But it's rousing good entertainment, equally playable by noivces or hardbitten wargaming veterans, is an excellent diversion, and has more of the flavor of a fantasy magic duel than any game I've played." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

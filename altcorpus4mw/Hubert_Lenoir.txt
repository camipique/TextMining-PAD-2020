Hubert Lenoir &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Hubert Lenoir''' (born August 14, 1994) is the stage name of '''Hubert Chiasson''', is a Canadian rock singer from Quebec City, Quebec. His debut solo album ''Darlène'' was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize. &&&&& &&&&& Originally from Quebec City, Chiasson and his older brother Julien released an album in 2015 under the band name The Seasons. &&&&& &&&&& ''Darlène'', a concept album about a love affair between a young woman from Quebec and a suicidal American tourist, was released concurrently with a novel of the same name by Chiasson's partner, writer Noémie D. Leclerc. The album incorporates glam rock, psychedelic rock and chanson influences. The album did not receive wide notice at first, but broke through to wider attention when he was invited to perform the single "Fille de personne II" on the sixth season finale of ''La Voix'' in May 2018. The Polaris nomination, in turn, resulted in media attention in both English Canada and the United States, markets where francophone artists from Quebec rarely break through without adding English material to their repertoires. &&&&& &&&&& He won three Prix Félix at the Gala de l'ADISQ in 2018, for Album of the Year (''Darlène''), Single of the Year ("Fille de personne II") and New Artist of the Year. &&&&& &&&&& At the Juno Awards of 2019, ''Darlène'' received three nominations, for Album of the Year, Pop Album of the Year and Francophone Album of the Year. &&&&& &&&&& Discography &&&&& ===Albums=== &&&&& *2018: ''Darlène'' &&&&& &&&&& ===Singles=== &&&&& *2018: "Fille de personne II" &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

After the opening of the St. Peters Canal, Lennox Passage saw an increase in marine traffic. For safety reasons, lighthouses were established along the route. The first lightkeeper was Daniel Clough, son of the merchant Nathaniel Cough, a recipient of one of the first Crown Land grants on Isle Madame. In the late 1800s the lighthouse was flanked by docks for limestone and plaster quarries and quays for the Isle Madame farmers to bring their produce and livestock to market. There was also a passenger ferry that landed on Grandique Pointe quite near the lighthouse. Many of these features can still be seen today. &&&&& &&&&& Due to erosion at the Grandique spit of land, the pole light was moved in 1900 and in 1906 a proper lighthouse was built. Storm damage caused the Grandique Point lighthouse to be moved for a second time. In the winter of 2010, the lighthouse was moved to its present location. &&&&& &&&&& The last lightkeeper at Grandique was Stanley Forgeron who took over in 1960. In 1961 Forgeron oversaw the conversion to an automated light in 1961 and became caretaker. &&&&& &&&&& ===Lightkeepers at Grandique Point=== &&&&& Lennox Passage Provincial Park and the historic Grandique Point Lighthouse &&&&& * Daniel Clough	1884-1908 &&&&& * D A Kaulbach	1908-1909 &&&&& * C A Kaulbach	1909-1919 &&&&& * Charles Shannon	1909-1923 &&&&& * John Doiron	 &&&&& * Henry Young	 &&&&& * Melvin Shannon	1939-1960 &&&&& * Stanley Forgeron	 1960-1961 &&&&& * Stanley Forgeron (as caretaker)	1961-1968 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * "Lennox Passage Provincial Park", ''Provincial Park and Park Reserve Series'', includes map. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Jacksonville-to-Fort Klamath Military Wagon Road &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Jacksonville-to-Fort Klamath Military Wagon Road''', from Jacksonville, Oregon to Fort Klamath Fort Klamath, Oregon, was built in 1863 by the U.S. Department of the Army. Segments of the road were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The listing included four contributing structures. &&&&& &&&&& It incorporates part or all of '''Rancheria Road''' (also known as '''Rancheria Trail'''), '''Fourmile Lake Rd.''', '''Butte Falls-to-Pelican Bay Road''', '''Mt. Pitt Road''', and '''Col. Drew's Road'''. It crossed '''Fourbit Ford''' on '''Fourbit Creek'''. &&&&& &&&&& It was the first "trans-Cascadian" wagon road, and connected the Rogue River Valley and the upper Klamath Basin. &&&&& &&&&& Among other effects, the road brought the first sawmill to the Klamath Basin. &&&&& &&&&& It is believed that 1909 is the date of the last wagon traversal of the entire road, and that the 1910 Cat Hill Fire contributed to its effective closure. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Daffodils (film) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Daffodils''''' is a New Zealand biographical musical drama film directed by David Stubbs. It stars Rose McIver and George Mason. &&&&& &&&&& Based on the award-winning New Zealand stage play inspired by a true story, the film follows an indie musician who, after being told by her father on his death bed, recounts her parents’ bittersweet romance. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Leaving her dying father’s bedside, singer Maisie (Kimbra) rushes to perform at an indie music gig in town. But as she sings the opening song, it is hard for her to ignore the heartfelt story she has just been told – the story of how her dad met and fell in love with her mother, and how it all devastatingly fell apart. &&&&& &&&&& As the night goes on, the love story of her father, Eric (George Mason), and her mother, Rose (Rose McIver), is shown through Maisie's eyes.

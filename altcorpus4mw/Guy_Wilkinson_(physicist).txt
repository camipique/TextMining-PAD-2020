Guy Wilkinson (physicist) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Guy Roderick Wilkinson''' (born 1968 at Ashton-under-Lyne) is a particle physicist, working on the Large Hadron Collider project at CERN, professor of physics at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Christ Church. &&&&& &&&&& Education &&&&& Wilkinson was educated at Bishop's Stortford College, Imperial College London and the University of Oxford where he was awarded a DPhil degree at Magdalen College in 1993 for a study of B⁰B⁰ oscillations at the Z⁰ resonance. &&&&& &&&&& ==Career and research== &&&&& Wilkinson's career began in the study of electroweak physics on the DELPHI experiment, taking part in the measurement of the mass and width of the zboson, and the mass of the W. Wilkinson currently specializes in CP-violation through measurements of processes involving the decays of hadrons containing beauty or charm quarks. He is a founding member and former spokesperson of the LHCb experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. &&&&& &&&&& ===Awards and honours=== &&&&& In 2017 was awarded the Chadwick Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics (IOP) for his work on heavy quarks. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Howell Downtown Historic District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Howell Downtown Historic District''' is a primarily commercial historic district located along five blocks of Grand River Avenue in the center of Howell, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Howell was first settled in 1833-34. The village was platted in 1835, and in 1836 became the county seat for Livingston County. The stretch along Grand River Avenue that is encompassed by this historic district has been the center of commercial activity since the 1830s. The buildings that are currently located in the district date from the 1870s. Disastrous fires in the district in 1887 and 1892 destroyed some of the earlier buildings, but replacement infill structures were quickly constructed. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The Howell Downtown Historic District is located in the central business district of the city, and incorporates parts of nine city blocks as well as the courthouse square. The district encompasses about fourteen acres, and includes sixty building, of which forty-six contribute to the historic significance of the district. These buildings date from 1865 to the mid-twentieth century, and include Italianate, Gothic Revival, High Victorian, Richardsonian Romanesque, Neoclassical, Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Art Deco architectural styles. The area is primarily commercial buildings of one and two stories in height, but also includes landmark public buildings such as the Livingston County Courthouse (separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places), the Carnegie Library, and the First Presbyterian Church. &&&&& &&&&& Significant buildings include: &&&&& * First Presbyterian Church (323 West Grand River Avenue): The First Presbyterian Church, located at the west end of the district, was designed by Sidney Badgley in 1915 in a modified English Gothic style.

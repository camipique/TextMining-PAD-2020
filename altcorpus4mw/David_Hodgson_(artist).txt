David Hodgson (artist) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''David Hodgson''' (1798â€“1864) was an English painter of landscapes and an active member of the Norwich School of painters. He was the son of the artist Charles Hodgson, whom he accompanied on a tour of Wales in 1805, when he was seven. He was taught art by John Crome at Norwich Grammar School. &&&&& &&&&& Hodgson never lived away from Norwich. He was employed as a drawing master at the Grammar School, which allowed him to live a comfortable, if uneventful, existence. He was an accomplished painter of architectural subjects, and exhibited works on a regular basis in Norwich, London and elsewhere. His paintings have at times been confused with those of his father, as his artistic style did not develop significantly during his career. A leading member the Norwich Society of Artists, he was a strong advocate for the arts in Norwich, and a man who was popular with both his pupils and his fellow artists during his lifetime. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Norwich Grammar School, where Hodgson was both educated and later employed as a drawing master &&&&& David Hodgson, the son of Charles Hodgson and his wife Nanny Chiswell, was born on 13 June 1798 and baptised at St Nicholas' Church, Great Yarmouth on 18 June. His father was a school master and amateur artist, who actively encouraged his son to develop his artistic talents. In 1805 the seven-year-old David accompanied his father on a tour of Wales, which included a stay in Chester and may have included a trip to Liverpool to visit relatives. As an adult he returned to paint aspects of Chester on numerous occasions. &&&&& &&&&& Norwich Grammar School &&&&& He attended Norwich Grammar School as a boy, where he was taught drawing by John Crome and mathematics by his father. &&&&& &&&&& Hodgson had an uneventful life and never lived away from Norwich. He succeeded his John Crome as the drawing master at Norwich School in about 1825. His occupation necessarily limited his artistic output but allowed him a comfortable existence. Living for most of his life in Tombland, a street situated close to the school, he taught a number of pupils who were to become artists of the Norwich School of painters. He was apparently very popular with his pupils. &&&&& &&&&& Artistic career &&&&& &&&&& Hodgson mainly worked in oils and produced few watercolours of a high quality. He was one of the second generation of artists of Norwich School of painters, several of whom were trained by their own fathers, but who were also influenced by the work of later painters. Like Henry Ninham, he became an accomplished painter of architectural subjects, and the two artists complemented each other in this respect, but Ninham's oil paintings are considered to possess more finesse. He exhibited his works on a regular basis at the Norwich Society of Arts and in other cities around England. In London, he showed one painting at the Royal Academy of Arts, twenty-seven paintings at the British Institution and eleven paintings with the Royal Society of British Artists at Suffolk Street. The art historian Harold Day, who along with Andrew Moore has provided a detailed account of Hodgson's life and work, praised him for his depiction of the interiors of buildings. &&&&& &&&&& Hodgson's works have at times been confused with those of his father. The number of paintings he exhibited during his career was affected by both his professional career as a schoolmaster and the large number of his works that he sold to private buyers. He received regular praise in the local press, for instance when the ''Norwich Chronicle'' praised his work as "promising", and on another occasion reported that he "demonstrated a lasting concern with problems of perspective". &&&&& &&&&& In 1822 he became Secretary of the Norwich Society of Artists and played an important part in the running of the Society at a time when it was struggling without permanent premises with which to exhibit its works. His surviving correspondence shows that he was a strong advocate for the arts in Norwich, and was among the first to write about the Norwich School of painters as an identifiable entity. He wrote an unpublished memoir about the life of his father, now kept in the British Museum. &&&&& &&&&& In 1832, the year Hodgson began his employment as a drawing master at the Grammar School, the Duke of Sussex appointed him as his Painter of Domestic Architecture, an appointment which does not seem to have produced much financial gain for Hodgson in the form of direct patronage. A visit to Ely in 1858 resulted in several paintings, but, like much he produced during the latter part of his career, they show little significant development in style from earlier works dating back to 1822. &&&&& &&&&& Family &&&&& On 1 January 1823, Hodgson married Frances Stone at St George's Church, Tombland. Her father Francis Stone (1769-1835) was an architect and the surveyor for Norfolk, whose achievements included the design of the Coumty Asylum at Thorpe St Andrew. In 1831 they published ''The Picturesque Views of all the Bridges belonging to the County of Norfolk'', which contained Hodgson's lithographs based on Stone's drawings. &&&&& &&&&& A son, Francis Henry Stone Hodgson, was born on 2 December 1823. Three other children were born: Anna Maria (born on 31 August 1823), Sarah Anne Frances (born on 19 March 1826), and Josephine Amelia, who was christened in March 1830 but who died in infancy. Anna Maria married Alfred George Stannard, himself from a family of Norwich School painters. &&&&& &&&&& In 1856 Hodgson moved from Tombland in the city centre to King Street. His wife Frances died in August 1863, and he died at his home in King Street on 22 April 1864, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew, Heigham. He left an estate of several thousand pounds to his family. His only son, the Reverend Francis Henry Stone Hodgson, also died that year, on 20 September. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& File:David Hodgson - The Old Fishmarket, Norwich - Google Art Project.jpg |''The Old Fishmarket, Norwich'' (1825), Yale Center for British Art &&&&& File:Market Place, Norwich, David Hodgson 1842.jpg|''Market Place, Norwich'' (1842), Norfolk Museums Collections &&&&& File:David Hodgson - The Nave of Norwich Cathedral, looking East.jpg|''The Nave of Norwich Cathedral'', Norfolk Museums Collections &&&&& File:Francis Stone and David Hodgson - Norwich Castle.jpg|Francis Stone and David Hodgson, ''Norwich Castle'' (1833) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * 591 works by (or relating to) David Hodgson at the Norfolk Museums Collections, including &&&&& :* Hodgson's prints for ''Britton's Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities'' (1830) &&&&& * Works by David Hodgson sold at auction according to Invaluable &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

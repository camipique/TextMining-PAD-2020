Haggai Carmon &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Haggai Carmon''' is an attorney, author of intelligence thrillers, and legal advice columnist. Carmon was representing the United States in its Israeli civil litigation (1985-2016) and also acted as outside legal counsel to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, and the U.S Consulate General in Jerusalem. For twenty years (1985-2005) he has been engaged by U.S federal agencies to conduct intelligence gathering, a task he performed under cover in more than 30 countries. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& &&&&& Carmon grew up in Tel Aviv. His father was a bank CEO, and wrote books about poetry and Eastern philosophy. Carmon graduated Tel Aviv University Law School in 1981 cum laude and went into the international business. During this period, he became a close adviser to Labor Party leader Shimon Peres. When he left Israel to pursue a Master’s degree in International Law, Government and Politics from St. John’s University in New York, Peres asked him to be the Labor Party’s chief delegate to the US. He was named as a special envoy to the Philippines in 1986. In 1985 he became an outside contractor to the Department of Justice, combining investigations with litigation. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& Carmon heads Carmon & Carmon, an international law firm where his team specializes in asset recovery, fraud investigation and litigation, and cross border disputes. &&&&& &&&&& Carmon has done work exposing the fraudulent activities of binary options firms that have laundered money, and helped recover $3 million for victims who lost money. He is quoted as comparing the method that binary options companies use to layer their corporate structure to “structures seen only in espionage organizations or among world-class money launderers or terrorist organizations.” &&&&& &&&&& Carmon spent 20 years working as an undercover investigator/litigator, traveling to over 30 countries to collect intelligence for the U.S. Government. About the experience, he has said, “during my twenty years of undercover work for the U.S Department of Justice and other federal agencies, I have experienced adventure, fear, and most of the time, a great sense of achievement.” He has also said, “obviously, in my years working for the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, I could not share the hair-raising aspects of my work with anyone but my supervisors, and some adventures not even with them. Sadly, many of these events, which are sometimes more fascinating and breathtaking than the best fiction I have ever read, will never see the light of day." In 2014 Carmon was appointed Honorary Consul of Estonia in Israel. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& Carmon has written five spy thrillers, telling the stories of the character Dan Gordon, a former Mossad agent having adventures around the world to gather intelligence on behalf of the U.S. government. His novels are based on his experiences helping the United States track down fugitives traveling worldwide. &&&&& &&&&& He began his writing career with the book ''Triple Identity'', which he started during an assignment collecting intelligence on an organized crime group in Northern Europe. He was encouraged by his supervisor David Epstein, who was positively critical of the writing in his reports, saying “because of the way you present the facts, they read like a thriller.” &&&&& &&&&& He has credited fiction authors Robert Ludlum and John La Carré as inspirations for his writing. &&&&& &&&&& Carmon has authored ''Foreign Judgments in Israel, Recognition and Enforcement'', an international law textbook, published by the Israel Bar Association with an introduction by the Deputy Chief Justice the Hon. Eliezer Rivlin. The book became an authority and was cited in 24 Israeli court cases, including 8 by the Supreme Court. The book was translated into English and was published by SPRINGER. &&&&& &&&&& Carmon has published dozens of articles on espionage, Iran and Middle Eastern affairs. &&&&& &&&&& Amazon has acquired the reprint rights of all Carmon’s thrillers and published them in a new format. &&&&& ''Defection Games'' became #1 bestseller in AMAZON in its genre (espionage) on 1/1/2014. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& &&&&& *''Defection Games'' (2013) &&&&& *''Triangle Of Deception'' (2009) &&&&& *''The Chameleon Conspiracy'' (2009) &&&&& *''The Red Syndrome'' (2006) &&&&& *''Triple Identity'' (2005) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

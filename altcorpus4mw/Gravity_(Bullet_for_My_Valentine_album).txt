Gravity (Bullet for My Valentine album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Gravity''''' is the sixth studio album by the Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine, which was released on 29 June 2018 via Spinefarm Records, their first album under the label. It is the first album with former Pitchshifter drummer Jason Bowld, who joined in 2016 to replace founding drummer Michael "Moose" Thomas. &&&&& It is also the first album to feature bassist Jamie Mathias as a contributing member. ''Gravity'' represents a significant change in sound compared to the band's previous releases, moving toward the nu metal sound similar to their early years as "Jeff Killed John". &&&&& &&&&& On 1 April 2018, Bullet for My Valentine debuted "Over It", the first single from ''Gravity'', on BBC Radio 1. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Upon its release, ''Gravity'' has received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, primarily due to the band's departure from their signature metalcore/thrash metal sound to a more nu metal style. Jeff Treppel of MetalSucks gave the album an extremely negative 0.5 out of 5, criticizing the sound for being a "bastard hybrid of Linkin Park-style radio rock" as well as the album's lyrical content and Matt Tuck's vocals. A significantly more positive review came from Lukas Wojcicki of Exclaim!, who stated that the "newly implemented formula works as intended", and commented that the "tracks are easily digestible and regrettably catchy", although stated that "metal purists" would find the album "frustrating". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& '''Bullet for My Valentine''' &&&&& * Matthew Tuck – lead vocals, rhythm guitar &&&&& * Michael "Padge" Paget – lead guitar, backing vocals &&&&& * Jamie Matthias – bass guitar, backing vocals &&&&& * Jason Bowld – drums, percussion &&&&& &&&&& '''Technical''' &&&&& * Carl Bown – production, mixing, keyboards &&&&& * Colin Richardson – production on "Don't Need You" &&&&& * Alex Robinson – mixing assistant &&&&& * Daniel Holub – art direction, design &&&&& * Ted Jensen - mastering at Sterling Sound, NYC &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) &&&&& &&&&& 50 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan) &&&&& &&&&& 47 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

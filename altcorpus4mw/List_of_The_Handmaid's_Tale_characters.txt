Due to her fertility, she is made a Handmaid to Commander Fred Waterford and his wife, Serena Joy, and is named "Offred". &&&&& &&&&& Moss was first announced as the lead actress in April 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Commander Fred Waterford === &&&&& Commander Fred Waterford (portrayed by Joseph Fiennes) is a high-ranking government official and June's master. Both he and his wife played an instrumental role in Gilead's founding. He wishes to have more contact with June outside of what is lawful between a Handmaid and her master, and starts inviting her to play nightly games of ''Scrabble''. &&&&& &&&&& Fiennes joined the cast in August 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Serena Joy Waterford === &&&&& Serena Joy Waterford (portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski) is Fred's wife and a former conservative cultural activist. She appears to have accepted her new role in a society that she helped create. She is poised and deeply religious, but capable of great cruelty and is often callous to June. She is desperate to become a mother. &&&&& &&&&& Strahovski joined the cast in August 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Emily === &&&&& Emily (portrayed by Alexis Bledel), also referred to as Ofglen and later Ofsteven, is June's shopping partner. Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed Ofglen is not as pious as she seems, and the two become friends. Ofglen had a wife and son, and was a university lecturer in cellular biology. Being homosexual is punishable by death in Gilead, and most university professors are sent to labour camps, but Ofglen was spared and made a Handmaid, due to her fertility. She is later captured and cruelly punished for her relationship with a Martha, and is sent to another household where she becomes "Ofsteven". She is involved with a resistance movement called "Mayday". &&&&& &&&&& Bledel was cast in January 2017. &&&&& &&&&& === Janine === &&&&& Janine (portrayed by Madeline Brewer) is a Handmaid who entered the Red Center for training at the same time as June and considers June a friend due to her kind treatment. Initially non-compliant, Janine's right eye is removed as a punishment. She becomes mentally unstable due to her treatment and often behaves in temperamental or childlike ways. She gives birth to a child for Warren and Naomi Putnam, whom they name "Angela", but Janine insists the baby's name is "Charlotte". Janine is later reassigned and becomes "Ofdaniel". She was temporarily assigned to the Colonies until a bombing at the new Rachel and Leah Center. &&&&& &&&&& Brewer was cast as Janine in August 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Aunt Lydia === &&&&& Aunt Lydia (portrayed by Ann Dowd) is a woman in charge of overseeing the Handmaids in their sexual reeducation and duties. She is brutal and subjects insubordinate Handmaids to harsh physical punishment, but she also cares for her charges and believes deeply in the Gileadean mission and doctrine. She appears to have a soft spot for Janine, and even goes so far as to address her by her given name on occasion. &&&&& &&&&& Dowd was cast in July 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Luke Bankole === &&&&& Lucas "Luke" Bankole (portrayed by O. T. Fagbenle) is June's husband from before Gilead. Because he is divorced (he and June began their relationship before his divorce from his first wife), their union is considered invalid in the new society. June is considered an adulteress and their daughter, Hannah, is considered illegitimate. Initially, June believes he has been killed, but it is later revealed Luke managed to escape to Canada. &&&&& &&&&& Fagbenle was cast in September 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Nick Blaine === &&&&& Nick Blaine (portrayed by Max Minghella) is Commander Waterford's driver and a former drifter from Michigan who has feelings for June. June and Nick develop an intimate relationship and she eventually discovers that he is an Eye, a spy for Gilead. &&&&& &&&&& Minghella was cast in July 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Moira === &&&&& Moira (portrayed by Samira Wiley), also referred to as Ruby, is June's best friend since college. She is already at the Red Center when June enters Handmaid training but escapes before being assigned to a home. She is recaptured and becomes "Ruby", a Jezebel. She seems to have given up hope of ever being free, but on meeting June again regains the conviction to escape. &&&&& &&&&& Wiley joined the main cast in July 2016. &&&&& &&&&& === Rita === &&&&& Rita (portrayed by Amanda Brugel) is a Martha at the Waterford home. She had a son who died fighting in the civil war when he was 19 years old. &&&&& &&&&& Brugel was cast in the recurring role of Rita in September 2016.

She initially follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a Handmaid is better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety. &&&&& *Alma (portrayed by Nina Kiri), also referred to as Ofrobert, is another Handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira, and Janine. She is frank and chatty, and often trades gossip and news with June. She is also involved with Mayday and becomes June's first contact with the resistance group. &&&&& *Dolores (portrayed by Jenessa Grant), also referred to as Ofsamuel, is a local Handmaid with a friendly and talkative nature. &&&&& *Briana (portrayed by Bahia Watson), also referred to as Oferic, is another local Handmaid who is friends with June. &&&&& *Hannah Bankole (portrayed by Jordana Blake) is June and Luke's daughter.

Cushing, his wife, and the Waterfords were friends before Gilead and used to travel together. Cushing is pointed out to replace Commander Pryce following the Rachel and Leah Center bombing, and he questions Offred about who aided her when she tried to flee the country.

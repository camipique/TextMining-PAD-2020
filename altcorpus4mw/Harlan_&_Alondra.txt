Like a bluesman who still believes things get better, he offsets their often weighty revelations masked in revelry with something that feels more soothing. Part conversation and part confessional, Harlan & Alondra is an alternative take on one of pop culture’s most fabled cities. Buddy drops the top and extends an invitation to ride with him, reminding us along the way that though it may not always be sunny by the beach, it’s always worthwhile." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& Credits adapted from Tidal &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ;Notes &&&&& * signifies a co-producer &&&&& *"Real Life Shit", "Legend", "Speechless" and "Young" features background vocals from Rose Gold &&&&& *"Hey Up There" features background vocals from Kent Jamz &&&&& *"Trouble on Central" features background vocals from Joyce Wrice &&&&& *"The Blue" features background vocals from Quiñ and Terrace Martin &&&&& *"Young" interpolates "Liberation" performed by Outkast and Cee-lo &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Electrorana limoae &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Electrorana limoae''''' is an extinct species of frog that lived in the Myanmar in the Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous) forests, 99 million years ago. &&&&& &&&&& History of the discovery &&&&& &&&&& A very well-preserved specimen of ''Electrorana'' was found in Myanmar inside a fragment of amber dating back to the Cretaceous period. This is an important finding because the amphibians were found in particular in the tropical forests, whose humid environment prevented fossilization. Together with the frog, a beetle was also found, possibly prey of the amphibian. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The dimensions of this amphibian are reduced, about two centimeters. Although it is not complete (it is absent part of the spine and a hind leg) and conservation shows a slight initial decomposition, the specimen is very useful in the scientific field because the skeletal structure is visible even to the naked eye. &&&&& &&&&& Links with current species &&&&& It has been hypothesized that Electrorana may show genetic links with living species, in particular with Alytes obstetricans. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

It was nominated for Top Christian Album at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& In an interview with ''Billboard''s Jim Asker, Daigle said "I don't shy away from singing about my faith. I think it conveys honesty, and people see authenticity. More people are going to relate to my music if it's sincere. I believe that wholeheartedly. That's how you reach people that might not have felt that the Christian genre was their home before. I want this to be such a record of joy, such a record of hope, that people experience a childlikeness again. In the time of making this record, I had to remember who I was as a child. I want people to reflect on, 'The innocence of my childhood ... how do I see myself through those eyes again? How do I love myself like that again? Where's that joy? Where's that hope?" &&&&& &&&&& Singles &&&&& "You Say" was released as the lead single from the album on July 13, 2018. It impacted Christian radio on July 9, 2018.

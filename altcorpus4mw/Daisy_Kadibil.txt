Daisy Kadibil &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Daisy Kadibil''' (''n√©e'' '''Burungu'''; 1923 - 30 March 2018) was an Aboriginal Australian woman whose experiences shaped the book ''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence'' and subsequent film ''Rabbit-Proof Fence''. &&&&& She was a member of the Stolen Generations, which were Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Kadibil was born in 1923. &&&&& Her mother was of the Martu people and her father Thomas Craig was of English descent, making her "half-caste" in the eyes of the Australian government. &&&&& In 1931 when Kadibil was about 8 years old, she was removed from her family in the Jigalong Community by the Australian government and sent to the Moore River Native Settlement. &&&&& Her cousins Molly and Gracie, whose mothers were Daisy's aunts, were also taken from home and sent to Moore River as well. &&&&& Daisy and Molly shared a father, Thomas Craig, making them both half-sisters and cousins. &&&&& The girls stayed only one night in the internment camp before making their escape to travel home. &&&&& Estimates of their journey range from long. &&&&& The trip took the girls 8 weeks to complete; they used Australia's rabbit-proof fence as a guide to travel north. &&&&& The journey home was difficult, as the girls had to sleep under bushes or in rabbit burrows. &&&&& Molly carried each of the younger girls in turn as they evaded search parties sent out by A. O. Neville; they also found their own food. &&&&& Farmers and hunters aided the girls by giving them food as well. &&&&& &&&&& Book based on her experiences &&&&& Kadibil's niece Doris Pilkington Garimara, who was Molly's daughter, authored ''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence'', which was published in 1996. &&&&& Doris had also been sent to the Moore River internment camp, and was not reunited with her mother Molly for 20 years. &&&&& &&&&& Later life and death &&&&& Kadibil worked as a housekeeper and cook on stations in the Pilbara of Western Australia. &&&&& She married and had four children. &&&&& She had children in Wiluna, Western Australia, then returned to Jigalong. &&&&& Members of her family established and still head the Parnngurr Community. &&&&& She died in a nursing home in South Hedland, Western Australia on March 30, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence'' (book inspired by her experience) &&&&& *''Rabbit-Proof Fence'' (film based on the above book) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

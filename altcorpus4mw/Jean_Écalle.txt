Jean Écalle &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jean Écalle''' (born 1950) is a French mathematician, specializing in dynamic systems, perturbation theory, and analysis. &&&&& &&&&& Ecalle was received in 1974 from the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay a doctorate under the supervision of Hubert Delange with Thèse d`Etat entitled ''La théorie des invariants holomorphes''. He is a ''directeur de recherché'' (senior researcher) of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) and is a professor at the University of Paris-Sud. &&&&& &&&&& He developed a theory of so-called "resurgent functions", analytic functions with isolated singularities, which have a special algebra of derivatives (''Alien calculus'', ''Calcul différentiel étranger''). "Resurgent functions" are divergent power series whose Borel transforms converge in a neighborhood of the origin and give rise, by means of analytic continuation, to (usually) multi-valued functions, but these multi-valued functions have merely isolated singularities without singularities that form cuts with dimension one or greater. Écalle's theory has important applications to solutions of generalizations of Abel's integral equation; the method of resurgent functions provides for such solutions a (Borel) resummation method for dealing with divergent series arising from semiclassical asymptotic developments in quantum theory. &&&&& &&&&& He applied his theory to dynamic systems and to the interplay between diophantine small denominators and resonance involved in problems of germs of vector fields. &&&&& &&&&& Independently of Yulij Ilyashenko he proved that the number of limit cycles of polynomial vector fields in the plane is finite, which Henri Dulac had already tried to prove in 1923. This result is related to Hilbert's sixteenth problem. &&&&& &&&&& In 1988 Écalle was the inaugural recipient of the of the Académie des Sciences. He was in 1990 an Invited Speaker at International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto. &&&&& &&&&& Selected publications &&&&& * '' Les Fonctions Résurgentes '', 3 volumes, pub. Math.

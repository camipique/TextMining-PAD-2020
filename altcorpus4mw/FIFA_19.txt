It can also be heard in the game’s reveal trailer. &&&&& &&&&& The Nintendo Switch port will receive upgrades over ''FIFA 18''. On 9 June 2018, EA Sports uploaded an official reveal trailer on their YouTube channel. Cristiano Ronaldo returned as the global cover star for a second consecutive time. He and Neymar appear on the Champions and Ultimate Edition packs for the game. It reported that it will include 55 national teams with 35 licensed leagues. &&&&& &&&&& It was confirmed that the game would have a licensed Serie A after being called "Calcio A" (due to licensing issues) in ''FIFA 17'' and ''FIFA 18''. The game will include the Chinese Super League, the first FIFA title to do so. However, it was confirmed that the game will not include the Russian Premier League, as it did in ''FIFA 18'' and previous FIFAs. Russian Premier League teams CSKA Moscow, Spartak Moscow, and Lokomotiv Moscow were kept, while Dinamo Zagreb, Dynamo Kyiv, Slavia Praha, and Viktoria Plzen were added to the game. Boca Juniors appears as ''Buenos Aires FC'' in the game since the club signed a deal with Konami; for the same reasons, Colo-Colo appears as ''CD Viñazur''. Once again, due to Konami securing deals with certain Brazilian clubs, the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A is featured in an incomplete form, this time with only 15 clubs, with the notable omissions of São Paulo, Palmeiras, Corinthians, Flamengo and Vasco da Gama, all of which are Konami partners. The remaining Brazilian clubs, while appearing with licensed branding, do not have any of their players licensed due to an ongoing judicial dispute over image rights, which are negotiated individually with each player, unlike other countries. &&&&& &&&&& As with every FIFA game, there are new skills included, with Andrés Iniesta’s signature move, ''La Croqueta'', featuring in ''FIFA 19''. 25 new icons have been added to the Ultimate Team in ''FIFA 19'', including Rivaldo, Roberto Baggio, Johan Cruyff, George Best, Luís Figo, Steven Gerrard, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, Bobby Moore, Franco Baresi, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Eusébio, Hidetoshi Nakata, Fabio Cannavaro, Michael Ballack, Miroslav Klose, Jens Lehmann, Claude Makelele, and Frank Lampard. New goal celebrations featured include Kylian Mbappé’s ‘Little Brother’, Roberto Firmino’s ‘Matador’, Mohamed Salah performing a sujud, Neymar’s ‘Hang Loose’, while Cristiano Ronaldo and his nearest teammate both perform Ronaldo’s trademark ‘Siii’ jump together. &&&&& &&&&& New stadiums confirmed for ''FIFA 19'' include the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Molineux Stadium, home of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Craven Cottage, home of Fulham, and the Cardiff City Stadium, home of Cardiff City and Wales national football team, ensuring all 20 English Premier League grounds are featured. There will also be 16 new stadiums from the Spanish La Liga, with 3 more from the Spanish Segunda Division. The only absent stadium from La Liga will be the Camp Nou, due to Barcelona's exclusive deal with rival game ''Pro Evolution Soccer 2019''. The only new Major League Soccer stadium featured is the Mercedes-Benz Stadium of Atlanta United, joining LA Galaxy's StubHub Center and Seattle Sounders' CenturyLink Field. &&&&& &&&&& The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, known as ''FIFA 19: Legacy Edition'', do not contain any new gameplay features aside from updated kits and squads. &&&&& &&&&& The Journey: Champions &&&&& The story-based mode that was introduced in ''FIFA 17'' returns in this installment and continues for the last installment under the title "The Journey: Champions". In this installment, Alex Hunter signs for Real Madrid and tries to become their star player after Cristiano Ronaldo leaves for Italian giants Juventus. As ''FIFA 19'' has the full Champions League licence, Hunter also competes for Champions League glory. Danny Williams returns trying to carve out a name for himself and compete for the Champions League hardware. Alex Hunter's half-sister, Kim Hunter, tries to compete for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The game mode features guest stars such as Kevin De Bruyne, Neymar Jr, Paulo Dybala, and Alex Morgan. Gareth Walker and Dino, who previously appeared in ''FIFA 17'' and ''FIFA 18'', don't appear in the storyline for unknown reasons, though Walker does send the characters a few abusive tweets during the story. The game also introduces other fictional new characters whose names include Beatriz "Bea" Villanova, who is Alex Hunter's new agent, Danny Williams' estranged brother and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. defender Terry, USWNT coach Marriane de Silva, Real Madrid C.F. coach Bartholomew Cazares, Danny Williams friend Ringo, and Melanie Trembley, a player of the Canada women's national soccer team who serves as Kim Hunter's rival in her story . &&&&& === Story === &&&&& Following a recap of the events of the previous journey, the game starts out with Alex Hunter, his half-sister Kim and friend Danny Williams watching a video of Hunter's grandfather, Jim Hunter, scoring his 100th career goal for his club in a First Division match at Coventry City. After that, the games moves to summer 2018, where they train with their respective teams for the pre-season friendly tournament held in Japan - ending with Alex and Danny's teams facing each other in the tournament's final. Kim is over in Los Angeles training with USA for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in France and quickly forms a partnership with teammate Alex Morgan during it. Alex also meets with Beatriz Villanova, the football agent that contacted him at the end of the previous journey - promising to make Alex an icon in world football. She keeps her promise and tells Alex that Real Madrid have offered him a 5 year contract, which he accepts and heads over to Spain to his new club. &&&&& &&&&& Meanwhile in England, Danny is preparing to make his debut in the Champions League with Alex's first club, with him being the target man in formation. In doing so he comes into contact with his estranged brother Terry, who plays as a defender for Paris Saint-Germain and their childhood rivalry is ignited. Alex is also preparing for his Champions League debut and gets help from various mentors in the team to help him boost his stats. Having already qualified for the World Cup, Kim and the USA team then play a friendly against Canada, while Kim continues to struggle with balancing her studies and school life. &&&&& &&&&& Both Alex and Danny's teams make it out of their groups in the Champions League and are drawn at opposite ends of the bracket. By this point Alex has become increasingly caught up in his brand and sponsor duties from his agents demands and the increasing fame is starting drive a wedge between his family. This is further seen when Kim comes to visit Alex before the World Cup and Alex doesn't come to pick her up from the airport due to him being too busy with his new clothing brand, much to both Kim and his mother's dismay. Due to this, Alex is dropped from the both the starting XI and substitutes before the first knockout game in the Champions League, meaning he has to fight his way back to the starting lineup to regain his manager's trust. Danny is also having agent issues as his friend Ringo and his agent have an argument over him wanting a new house or not, with the player given a choice as to which person he sides with. Nevertheless, both their teams make it to the semi-finals of the competition. &&&&& &&&&& Kim, meanwhile, has made it to the World Cup in France and her strike force with Morgan continues to grow. However, following an argument over her being dropped to the bench, Kim is dropped from the starting lineup and almost sent home. However, due to her impressive level of skill for her age, she is given a vote of confidence by the manager and starts the last group game, getting the side through to the knockout rounds. Alex and Beatriz then come to visit Kim before the first knockout game and Beatriz, having been impressed by Kim's abilities, tells her that she should go pro and not go to college. Despite her father's rejection of the idea as the team progresses, he comes more around to the idea. Meanwhile in the Champions League, Alex faces Juventus and Danny once again faces his brother's side. Both defeat their rivals and progress to the Champions League Final, with Danny and Terry reconciling after the end of the match. &&&&& &&&&& Over in France, Kim prepares for the World Cup final against Canada, despite almost getting dropped again due to the coach finding out she was discussing pro contracts, which a player cannot do while on international duty. If Kim wins the final against Canada, her and her team celebrate the USA's fourth World Cup win and the nation becoming only the second team in Women's World Cup history to retain the trophy, and it's implied that she signed a pro contract with a club and moves out of LA. If she loses she goes to college to finish her studies, though she still hopes to go pro one day. Then the game moves to the 2019 Champions League Final at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid where Real Madrid face Danny's Premier League side. Regardless of who wins the final, the losing character takes their defeat graciously as the other celebrates being crowned the best club team in Europe. The game ends with Jim telling Alex that he has never been prouder of him and that when he retires, he will be the greatest Hunter of all time, drawing Alex Hunter's journey to an end. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& In the United Kingdom, ''FIFA 19'' opened at number-one on the software sales chart, but opening-week sales were down 25% compared to ''FIFA 18''.

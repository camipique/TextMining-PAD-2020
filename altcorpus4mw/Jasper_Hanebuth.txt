He was the son of Hans Hanebuth, a cotter in Groß-Buchholz. &&&&& &&&&& Jasper Hanebuth became a mercenary in Swedish service during the Thirty Years' War. Even during the war, he acquired the Hanover citizenship, but soon lost it again as he did not pay his tax debts. &&&&& &&&&& Later he preyed mainly in the Eilenriede, a forest near the present-day Hanover Zoo. He partly carried out his raids with others, including Caspar Reusche and Hänschen von Rode, a descendant of an old Hanoverian patrician family. He often shot his victims from afar without knowing whether they could find money. &&&&& &&&&& Hanebuth was described as a rude man whose tantrums were feared. He is considered as an example of the everyday violence and brutality of morals after the end of the Thirty Years' War. His victims included his "robber bride". &&&&& &&&&& Hanebuth was last hired as a horse dealer until he was reported for a horse theft and arrested on November 14, 1652. But then he confessed to 10 thefts and 19 murders. Despite repeated threats of torture, "meticulous according to the high justice", in the council of the Altes Rathaus, where he confessed to his guilt, but also raising doubts. But after nearly a year in prison, on 3–4 February 1653, he was sentenced "to be judged by the breaking wheel by his limbs from life to death". &&&&& &&&&& On February 4, 1653, Jasper Hanebuth was executed in front of a stone gate on the breaking wheel. &&&&& &&&&& Aftermath &&&&& Hanebuth is still present in the consciousness of the Hanoverians: &&&&& &&&&& * For sculptor Peter Köster, who died in 1661, for Jasper Hanebuth's younger brother Hinrich, he created a tombstone that can still be found today at the St. Nicolai church in Bothfeld. &&&&& * However, many legends surrounding the robber can not be confirmed from historical sources; according to legend, he had stretched a string over the forest chapel, which was connected with a small bell, so as to be rung when merchants came by. Nor was his home a robber's den in the Eilenriede. Similarly, it has not been proven that he supported the poor from the nearby village of Groß-Buchholz with his prey. &&&&& * A cross that existed at the beginning of the stone gate field from the time before Hanebuth's execution was later incorrectly assigned to the event, but then in 1929 it was given the name White Cross Square on the Lister mile. &&&&& * "Hanebuth's gang" on the high bank "is probably the remainder of a passage under the city wall to the leash", which was filled up after a short distance. &&&&& * At the turn of the 19th century there were still postcards with the motif of "Hanebuth's Block" on the Schiffgraben in front of the former entrance building of the zoo. &&&&& * The 1967 street Hanebuthwinkel in Groß-Buchholz on the Eilenriede at Steuerdieb reminds with their naming of the robber. &&&&& * Since 1991, the information board "Hof Pieper" in Hanebuth's birthplace reminds of the criminal. &&&&& * In front of the birthplace of Jasper Hanebuth, the sculpture "Large pedestal torso XX" was erected, a work of the sculptor Waldemar Otto from the year 1986 and on loan from the Stübler Gallery. An additional sign with the inscription "Jasper Hanebuth's last victim", was attached to the concrete base below the armless sculpture. &&&&& * Related to Hanebuth is the 2010 history novel "The Concubine of the murderer" by Bettina Szrama, in which Hanebuth is seen as "a resurrection as a dark novel hero". &&&&& &&&&& Literature &&&&& &&&&& * Joachim Lehrmann: ''Robber gangs between Harz and Weser - Hanover, Braunschweig, Hildesheim - A historical review''.

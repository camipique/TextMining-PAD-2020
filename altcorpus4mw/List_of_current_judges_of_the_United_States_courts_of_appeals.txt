List of current judges of the United States courts of appeals &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts &&&&& This is a list of all current judges of the United States courts of appeals. The United States courts of appeals or circuit courts are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal court system. The list includes both "active" and "senior" judges, both of whom currently hear and decide cases. &&&&& &&&&& Of the thirteen US courts of appeals, twelve are divided into geographical jurisdictions. Eleven are referred to numerically, while the other is referred to as the District of Columbia Circuit. The thirteenth is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which has nationwide jurisdiction over appeals based on subject matter, for example patent law. &&&&& &&&&& Congress has currently authorized 179 judgeships , though the number of current judges will be higher because of some judges electing senior status. Only active judges may fill an authorized judgeship. Some judgeships are vacant and are waiting on either a presidential nominee or senate approval, most often the latter. As of April 1, 2019, there are 8 vacancies including 4 for the 9th circuit. &&&&& &&&&& Per the practice of visiting judges, sometimes appeals courts cases are heard and decided by active, senior, or retired judges from the US district courts, US courts of appeals, or US Supreme Court, for cases either within or outside of their assigned geographical jurisdiction. Some judges with senior status are currently inactive. They are not yet retired and may return to actively hearing cases. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] &&&&& As of May 23, 2014 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] &&&&& As of October 17, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]] &&&&& As of March 18, 2019 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]] &&&&& As of March 21, 2019 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] &&&&& As of July 19, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]] &&&&& As of March 11, 2019 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]] &&&&& As of May 23, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] &&&&& As of December 12, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] &&&&& As of April 1, 2019 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit]] &&&&& As of May 17, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]] &&&&& As of August 3, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia Circuit]] &&&&& As of March 18, 2019 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Current Judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] &&&&& As of July 8, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

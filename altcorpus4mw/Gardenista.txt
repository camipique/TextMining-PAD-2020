Gardenista &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Gardenista''' is an outdoor spaces and design website launched by Julie Carlson and Michelle Slatalla in 2011 initially as a section of Remodelista, and then as a separate website in 2012. It is currently operated by Realtor.com, after a July 2016 acquisition. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Gardenista was launched as an independent website in 2012, with the mission to provide a guide to stylish outdoor spaces. The idea was born when Carlson (Editor in Chief of Gardenista’s parent website, Remodelista) asked Slatalla for advice about gardening mint. Slatalla has been the Editor in Chief since launch, working closely with Carlson. &&&&& &&&&& The website received early recognition from TIME Magazine when it was selected as one of TIME’s 25 Best Blogs in 2012. In 2013, Gardenista was a runner-up for a Webby in the Lifestyle category. &&&&& &&&&& Site features &&&&& Gardenista’s primary aim is to serve as a sourcebook for well designed outdoor spaces, which includes how-to content (like DIY posts, and guides to Garden Design 101) and catalogues of information about various plants and seeds. In addition, the website publishes Garden Visits and advice for achieving similar features in one’s home garden. &&&&& &&&&& Similar to its parent website Remodelista, Gardenista has an invitation-only directory of landscape architects, landscape designers, and other outdoor design professionals, as well as an annual “Considered Design Awards” contest. Guest judges for Gardenista’s Considered Design Awards have included Rita Konig, Sheila Bridges, Deborah Needleman, and Sam Hamilton. &&&&& &&&&& Gardenista also has a shop that curates the team’s favorite garden-related tools, as well as a catalogue of plants and seeds that can be ordered directly through Gardenista. &&&&& &&&&& Gardenista’s Instagram account received recognition from The Irish Times as one of the Eight Best Instagram Gardeners to Follow in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& In October 2016, ''Gardenista: The Definitive Guide to Outdoor Spaces'' (), written by Slatalla with photography by Matthew Williams, was published by Artisan. The book includes features on 13 gardens (including that of Slatalla), case studies on classic gardening trends, 100 favorite every-day gardening objects, and tips for home gardeners. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Gardenista &&&&& * Remodelista &&&&& * The Organized Home &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

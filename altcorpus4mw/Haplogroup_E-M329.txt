127	Haplogroup_E-M329
Haplogroup E-M329 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Ethiopian spatial distribution of haplogroup E1b1a2-M329 based on Plaster et al. 2011 &&&&& &&&&& '''E1b1a2-M329''' is a haplogroup, a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation. It is defined by the SNP mutation M329. The majority of the cases observed have been found in East Africa. It has been found in ancient DNA isolated from a 4,500 year old Ethiopian fossil called Mota. This haplogroup is frequent in Southwestern Ethiopia, especially among Omotic-speaking populations. Semino et al. (2004) found 2 Ethiopian Oromo in a study of >2400 individuals, including 78 Oromo. Cadenas et al. (2007) found 1 case in Qatar, out of 72 people tested there in that study. &&&&& &&&&& Genetics &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

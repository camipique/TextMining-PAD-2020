Laz people in Georgia &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Laz people in Georgia''' (Georgian: ლაზები საქართველოში ''Lazebi Sakartveloshi'', Laz: ლაზეფე ოქორთურაშე ''Lazepe Okorturaşe'') refers to an indigenous Kartvelian-speaking ethnic group inhabiting the Black Sea coastal regions of Turkey and Georgia. There are about 2,000 Laz in Georgia. Laz identity in Georgia has largely merged with a Georgian identity, and the meaning of "Laz" is seen as merely a regional category. Kolkhoba is an annual Laz festival held each year at the end of August or the beginning of September in Sarpi, a village in Georgia.  &&&&& &&&&& Sopho Khalvashi was a first Georgian musician of Laz heritage who represented her home nation at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

HNLMS Bruinvis (1992) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''HNLMS ''Bruinvis'' (S810)''' is a of the Royal Netherlands Navy. She entered service in 1994 as the fourth, and final, submarine of the ''Walrus''-class, after the HNLMS ''Walrus'', ''Zeeleeuw'' and ''Dolfijn''. ''Bruinvis'' has been deployed both for naval exercises and in combat operations around the world. The submarine is currently (as of December 2015) in active service. &&&&& &&&&& Ship history &&&&& ''Bruinvis'' was laid down on 14 April 1988 at the Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij ("Rotterdam Dry Dock Company") yard in Rotterdam. The baptism and the launching took place four years later on 25 April 1992 by the wife of the Secretary of State for Defense at the time, mrs. J.M. baroness van Voorst tot Voorst - Bloys van Treslong. The HNLMS ''Bruinvis'' - like the HNLMS ''Dolphin'' - was built in the Scheepsbouwloods, transported to the ship lift and launched via the boat lift. On 5 July 1994 the ship was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy and put into service. &&&&& &&&&& The fire on board the HNLMS ''Walrus'' during her construction delayed the construction of the other three submarines of the ''Walrus''-class, which meant that the ''Bruinvis'' went later into service than earlier was expected. &&&&& &&&&& In 2016 ''Bruinvis'' docked in Gibraltar as part of a mission, it also marked the first docking of a Dutch submarine to Gibraltar in over a decade. &&&&& &&&&& The HNLMS ''Bruinvis'' took part in Operation Ocean Shield alongside HNLMS Rotterdam in 2011 and 2012. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Sources=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& Met onderzeeboot Bruinvis in Schotse wateren &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

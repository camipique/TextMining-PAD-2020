J. Wadsworth Ritchie &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''James Wadsworth Ritchie''' (May 24, 1861 – March 22, 1924) was an American sportsman and rancher who was prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Ritchie was born on May 24, 1861 in Geneseo, New York. He was the son of Montgomery Harrison Ritchie and Cornelia Wadsworth (1837–1921). From his parents marriage, he had one brother, Arthur Ritchie, who died in childhood. Through his father, he was descended from Federalist party leader Harrison Gray Otis. His paternal grandparents were Mary Craig (née Wharton) Wadsworth and General James S. Wadsworth. Among his extended family members was uncle James Wolcott Wadsworth and first cousin, James W. Wadsworth Jr., who were both successful New York politicians. Ritchie's aunt, Elizabeth Wadsworth, married Arthur Smith-Barry, 1st Baron Barrymore in 1889, becoming Lady Barrymore. &&&&& &&&&& Following his father's early death in 1864 from an illness contracted in battle during the U.S. Civil War that also killed his grandfather (during the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia), his mother met and, in 1869, remarried to John George Adair, a Scottish-Irish businessman and landowner from County Donegal. After their marriage, they lived at Glenveagh Castle in Ireland, in Great Britain, and New York City, where Adair, also known as "Jack Adair", opened a brokerage house. His stepfather also owned a large cattle ranch, known as JA Ranch, southeast of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& After his step-father's death in 1885, his now twice-widowed mother divided the JA Ranch holdings with Charles Goodnight. In 1887, Ritchie traveled to the ranch to learn the cattle business from his stepfather's old partner who continued to manage the late Adair's properties, and hired Ritchie as a cowhand, eventually promoting him to foreman. Reportedly, Ritchie adapted quickly to the Panhandle and lived in a dugout at the original Tule campsite. &&&&& &&&&& In January 1888, Ritchie was demoted for gambling. Soon afterward, his mother persuaded him to travel to New York where Ritchie he managed the New York City Police Department's purchase of horses from the ranch.

She was the daughter of Margaret Augusta (née Peckham) Tooker and Gabriel Mead Tooker.

Emily, who was said to be "not in the least bit pretty," had previously been engaged to A. Lanfear Norrie in 1893.

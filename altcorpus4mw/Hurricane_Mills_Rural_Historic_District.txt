Hurricane Mills Rural Historic District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Hurricane Mills Rural Historic District''', in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The listing included five contributing buildings, four contributing structures, and two contributing sites. &&&&& &&&&& It has also been known as '''Hurricane Forge''' and as the '''Loretta Lynn Ranch'''. &&&&& &&&&& It includes: &&&&& *Hurricane Mill, built in stages from 1897 to c.1910 &&&&& *Hurricane Creek Dam, in current concrete-faced form since about 1912, renovated to improve upon previous stone dam. The original wood and stone dam on the site was built c.1839. &&&&& *Hurricane Mills Bridge, a historic steel truss bridge built by the Nashville Bridge Company in 1911. It is long with a 100-foot long &&&&& pin-connected Pratt through truss. &&&&& *Hurricane Mills Bridge, concrete, non-contributing &&&&& *a school &&&&& *Hillman-Anderson House, an I-house with porches and extensions built in stages during c.1876-c.1916 &&&&& *Hurricane Mills General Merchandise Store & Post Office (1926) &&&&& &&&&& The district was deemed notable as "a superb example of a small, crossroads community where agricultural, industrial, and commercial businesses thrived between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Since the late 1960s, this historic community has been the home of the legendary country music entertainer Loretta Lynn and her family. Loretta Lynn currently owns the entire historic district, with the exception of the public cemetery. The unincorporated Hurricane Mills community, including most of the resources in this historic district, has been used as a background set in numerous entertainment productions, including country music videos, television commercials and specials, and country music album covers. Hurricane Mills was also featured prominently in the Oscar-winning movie ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' (1980). Hurricane Mills has been a popular site for outdoor recreation for the local community since its establishment; however, this property, which is now known as the "Loretta Lynn Ranch & Family Campground," has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Tennessee." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

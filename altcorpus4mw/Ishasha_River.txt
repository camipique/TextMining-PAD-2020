178	Ishasha_River
Ishasha River &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The Ishasha is a river in southwest Uganda, running from its source north of Kabale to its mouth at Lake Edward. Its length is very roughly ignoring the many small meanders. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The river arises from drainage channels in farmland some northwest of Kabale. It runs northwest through mountain valleys to its entrance into the northern lobe of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. From there, it continues northwest under the heavy forest canopy to the Kanungu dam, part of the Kanungu Hydroelectric Power Station, also known as the Ishasha Power Station. &&&&& &&&&& Leaving the power station, it meanders northwest through hilly terrain until it joins and becomes part of the Uganda-Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) border. After turning north, it continues past the DRC town of Ishasha at the southern tip of Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP). It remains the western border of QENP until it enters the marshlands on the shore of Lake Edward. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of rivers of Uganda &&&&& *List of rivers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

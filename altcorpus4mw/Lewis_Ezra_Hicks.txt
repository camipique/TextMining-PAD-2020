Professor of Science Bruce H. Weber has noted that Hicks "warned of the ambiguity of conflating design seen as created contrivances with intent or purpose resulting from the action of natural law. He saw defenders of design logically and unjustifiably gliding from the first usage to the second in many of their arguments. For this reason alone, he thought design arguments should be banished." &&&&& &&&&& Publications &&&&& * ''A Critique of Design-Arguments'' (1883) &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Eutaxiology &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

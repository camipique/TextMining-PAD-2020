Eve Systems &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Eve Systems''' (branded as simply '''Eve''') is a German smart home and home automation producer founded in June 27, 2018. The brand originally existed as a line of smart home products manufactured by Elgato Systems, a company best known for a line of video-recording and gaming products. The Elgato brand and gaming division of the company was sold to Corsair Components in June 2018, while the Eve brand was spun off into a separate company. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& The brand can be traced back in 2014 when Elgato introduced a home monitoring system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth. In May 2018, Elgato introduced Eve Aqua, a smart water controller. &&&&& &&&&& In June 2018, Corsair acquired the gaming departments of Elgato, while Elgato's smart home team remains their own company and was spun off as Eve Systems. &&&&& &&&&& == Products == &&&&& &&&&& === Smart key === &&&&& key fob &&&&& Elgato manufactures and markets a smart-key system. The system comes with a small 10-gram device that is placed on a key ring, in a purse, inside a car, or somewhere else. Then it communicates with an Elgato app on an iOS device. If it is set up for keys, the app will alert the user when they are 10 meters away from their keys, indicating that they may have forgotten them. It takes advantage of the "Smart Bluetooth" Apple implemented in iOS 7. A review in TheNextWeb said it was "money well spent" and worked "exactly as described", but that the beeping of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find my Phone app. A review in Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars. &&&&& &&&&& === Smart home === &&&&& In September 2014, Elgato announced a home monitoring system called Eve, which monitors a home's air pressure, water usage, temperature, air quality and other factors. Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, which is expected to come with Apple iOS 8, is released. It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device. &&&&& &&&&& As of July 2018, the current series of smart home products includes: &&&&& &&&&& * Eve Flare – portable smart LED lamp &&&&& * Eve Button – smart home remote &&&&& * Eve Degree – Wi-Fi-enabled thermostat &&&&& * Eve Door & Window – door and window sensor &&&&& * Eve Light Switch – smart wall switch &&&&& * Eve Motion – motion sensor &&&&& * Eve Room – indoor air quality, temperature, and humidity sensor &&&&& * Eve Smoke – smoke detector &&&&& * Eve Thermo – radiator valve &&&&& * Eve Aqua – sprinkler controller &&&&& &&&&& === Smart power === &&&&& In late 2014, Elgato introduced the Smart Power battery backup for mobile devices. It communicates with the user's bluetooth-enabled device to provide notifications and calendar reminders when it needs to be charged. &&&&& &&&&& In 2016, Elgato released Eve Energy, a smart plug which provides power meter features through its mobile app. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

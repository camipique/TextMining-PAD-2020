Enonic XP &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Enonic XP''' is a free and open-source web application platform and content management system (CMS) in one based on Java and Elasticsearch. Developed by the Norwegian software company Enonic, the microservice web platform can be used to build progressive web applications, complex websites, or web-based APIs. Enonic XP uses an application framework for coding server logic with JavaScript, and has no need for SQL as it ships with an integrated content repository. The CMS is fully decoupled, meaning developers can create traditional websites and landing pages, or use XP in headless mode, that is without the presentation layer, for loading editorial content onto any device or client. Enonic is used by major organizations in Norway, including the national postal service Norway Post, the insurance company Gjensidige, the national lottery Norsk Tipping, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, and all the top football clubs in the national football league for men, Eliteserien, as well as the national charity Scope in the United Kingdom. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& Enonic XP has embedded web content management, blending applications and websites into one experience. The content management system (CMS) functionality includes a visual drag and drop editor, a landing page editor, support for multi-site and multi-language, media and structured content, advanced image editing, responsive user interface, permissions and roles management, revision and version control, and bulk publishing. Content and website(s) are managed through the “Content Studio”, while integrations and applications can be directly installed via the “Applications” section in XP, where the platform finds apps approved in the official Enonic Market. &&&&& &&&&& There are no third-party databases in Enonic XP. Instead the developers have built a distributed storage repository on top of the search engine Elasticsearch, avoiding the need to index content. The system brings together capabilities from Filesystem, NoSQL, document stores, and search in the storage technology, which automatically indexes everything put into the storage. &&&&& &&&&& Enonic XP supports deployment of server side JavaScript and Java applications, using the framework PurpleJS, which includes code build by Enonic. PurpleJS melds Java and JavaScript, and is able to run lightweight JavaScript server applications without the complexity of the Node.js programming model. The open-source framework runs on top of a JVM (Java virtual machine), and allows developers to run the same code in the browser and on the server, thus enabling them to employ JavaScript while working with existing Java projects. &&&&& &&&&& While running on the Java virtual machine, Enonic XP can be deployed on most infrastructures. The dependency on a third party application server to deploy code has been removed, as the platform is an application server by default. A developer can for instance insert his own modules and code straight into the system while it is running. JavaScript unifies all the technical elements, and Enonic XP features a MVC framework where everything on the back-end can be coded with server-side JavaScript. The Enonic platform can use any template engine. The most used one, Thymeleaf, allows users to create a plain HTML5 document and use it as a view, allowing a designer to work on the HTML file, while a developer can make it more functional and dynamic. &&&&& &&&&& === Progressive web apps === &&&&& Another feature of Enonic XP is the possibility for developers to create progressive web apps (PWA). A PWA is a web application that is a regular web page or website, but can appear to the user like a mobile application. In early 2017 Enonic released “Office League”, an open-source progressive web application built on the Enonic XP platform, making it one of the first companies in Scandinavia to develop and release a production-ready PWA. Later in 2017 Enonic released a PWA starter kit, helping developers build scalable PWAs in Enonic XP. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Enonic AS was founded in 2000 by Morten Øien Eriksen and Thomas Sigdestad. The software company specialized in building services and solutions using Java, including a content management system known as “Enonic CMS”. Being aware that they had application, database, and website teams working on separate silos toward the same goal, Enonic sought to combine the different elements into a single software. The resulting application platform Enonic XP, first released in 2015, includes a CMS as an optional surface layer. &&&&& &&&&& === Release history === &&&&& Enonic XP assumed the mantle from the previous content management system Enonic CMS, and thus began with “version 5.0.0.” The following list only contains major releases. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Version &&&&& &&&&& Release date &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& February 17, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Initial version of Enonic XP. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& April 22, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Added support for existing (simple) commonjs modules, handling of shortcuts in portal, HTML editor input-type based on TinyMCE, and more. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& June 5, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Added improvements to the TinyMCE editor, support for localization, page contributions, and more. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& July 7, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Contained fixes to prepare for upgrading to 6.0, mainly tools rewritten in Java and bug fixes. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& September 8, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Modules changed to applications, added several new tools for developers, added new publishing wizard, page templates now optional, new image editor with focal point and cropping features, JavaScript API improvements, and improved admin UI search. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& October 19, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Added content detail panel UI, insert from context menu, new API capabilities, new project init tool, and improvement of UI responsiveness, site config UI,component panel and image editor. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& November 9, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Added custom error pages, response filters, perfect caching, and HTTP compression. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& December 22, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& Added clustering support, plugable admin widgets, multipart handling in JS, new JS libraries, and hot-reload development mode. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& February 23, 2016 &&&&& &&&&& Added support for XSLT transformations in import to toolbox, app installation support, local/cluster application deployment, plugable admin tool, WebSocket support in portal. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& April 19, 2016 &&&&& &&&&& New native installers for OSX and Windows, new text component editor, page fragments, inline image crop, version history restore, controller mapping, and default values for input types. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& June 29, 2016 &&&&& &&&&& Added dependency widget, editor macros, name transliteration, safe deletes, search improvements, and, identity providers that allow connections to external user stores. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& September 21, 2016 &&&&& &&&&& Added schema help texts, custom selector input type, application icons, and a new welcome tour, with improvements to the page editor and the HTML editor. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& November 21, 2016 &&&&& &&&&& Added the option set form item, expandable help texts, a new asynchronous task API, detailed metrics about the system for monitoring, global app configuration, and improvements to preview on the mobile platform, the libraries and the system in general. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& January 19, 2017 &&&&& &&&&& New Node API, time-based publishing, native tabs, and several other improvements. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& April 24, 2017 &&&&& &&&&& Allowed users to undo deletion, plus improvements to the HTML editor, publishing wizard and bulk selection, and other changes. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& July 13, 2017 &&&&& &&&&& Added display page template info in details panel, dump and load versions, implementation of handling of publishing issues in Content Studio, multi-repository search, support of custom image scaling in HTML area. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& October 13, 2017 &&&&& &&&&& Added content selector switch between tree structure and flat structure, vacuum tool to find and remove unused binaries, new features for image editing and multilingual admin console, plus modularizing the product in three parts: backend runtime, apps, and supporting libraries. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& December 22, 2017 &&&&& &&&&& New features to the Content Studio UI, including warning for incoming dependencies and gallery mode for image selector.

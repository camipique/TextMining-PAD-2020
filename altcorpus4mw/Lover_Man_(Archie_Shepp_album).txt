Lover Man (Archie Shepp album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Lover Man''''' is an album by saxophonist Archie Shepp's Quartet with vocalist Annette Lowman which was recorded in Holland in 1988 and released on the Timeless label the following year. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The AllMusic review by Steve Loewy said: "Shepp has been criticized for his more commercial ventures such as this, but many will enjoy its accessibly light charm. ... There is a touch of a blues and R&B feel that adds to the ambiance. Unlike some of Shepp's other ventures, there are no attempted serious statements made -- only relaxing, good, swinging jazz that lifts the spirits or touches the soul, if only just a bit". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& # "Stars Are in Your Eyes" (Archie Shepp) – 6:28 &&&&& # "Lover Man" (Jimmy Davis, Ram Ramirez, James Sherman) – 6:11 &&&&& # "Brand New World/Breaking a New Day" (Shepp) – 9:22 &&&&& # "Yesterdays" (Jerome Kern, Otto Harbach) – 5:38 &&&&& # "My Funny Valentine" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) – 5:21	 &&&&& # "Lush Life" (Billy Strayhorn) – 6:48 &&&&& # "Squeeze Me" (Fats Waller) – 6:17 &&&&& # "Margy Pargy" (Dave Burrell) – 5:18 &&&&& # "Tribute to Bessie Smith" (Shepp) − 8:37 Additional track on CD release &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Archie Shepp – tenor saxophone &&&&& *Annette Lowman – vocals &&&&& *Dave Burrell – piano &&&&& *Herman Wright – bass &&&&& *Stephen McCraven – drums &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Woodriffe, were shot and killed in an apartment building in southeast Washington DC while trying to apprehend Billie Austin Bryant, who had robbed the Citizens Bank in nearby Oxon Hill, Maryland. Bryant was apprehended the same day, only two hours after he was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List, the shortest amount of time between placement on the list and capture.  Woodriffe was the first African-American FBI agent to die in the line of duty. The killing of him and Palmisano marked only the second time that two FBI men were killed together; the first time had been on November 27, 1934, when Ed Hollis and Samuel Cowley were killed by gangster Baby Face Nelson.  &&&&& *'''Died:''' Albert Hill, 79, British track and field athlete, 1920 Olympic gold medalist in the 800m and 1,500m races &&&&& &&&&& [[January 9]], 1969 (Thursday) &&&&& *The Condon Committee, chaired by University of Colorado physicist Edward Condon, released its report ''Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects'' and concluded that "nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby." The Condon Report, commissioned by the United States Air Force at the cost of $520,000 recommended that the Air Force close its Project Blue Book investigation of UFO reports, and the USAF would do so at the end of the year. &&&&& *New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath accepted an award from the Miami Touchdown Club, three days before Super Bowl III and said in his after-dinner remarks to the crowd,  At the time of Namath's boast, the nine-year old American Football League had not come close to winning either of the first two Super Bowls against the 49-year old NFL, losing by scores of 35-10 and 33-14. &&&&& &&&&& [[January 10]], 1969 (Friday) &&&&& *The publishers of ''The Saturday Evening Post'' announced that the weekly magazine would cease publication after almost 148 years, discontinuing after its February 8 issue. Publisher Martin S. Ackerman said at a news conference that the ''Post'' had lost more than five million dollars in 1968 and commented that "We just could not sell enough advertising and cut expenses fast enough. Apparently, there is just not the need for our product in today's scheme of living."  The ''Post'' had started publication in 1821 in Philadelphia, using the same printing shop used by the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', which had been founded by Benjamin Franklin. Until 1942, the magazine's masthead had carried the false claim that it was "founded in 1728 by Benjamin Franklin".  &&&&& * The Soviet Union launched their second exploration vehicle toward Venus in five days, ''Venera 6'', after the Sunday launch of ''Venera 5''. The second probe would arrive on May 17, a day after the first one's arrival, and, like the first, would cease functioning above the surface because of the Venusian temperature and atmospheric pressure.  &&&&& &&&&& [[January 11]], 1969 (Saturday) &&&&& *The Kingdom of Sweden became the first Western nation to grant formal diplomatic recognition to the Communist republic of North Vietnam. Although the decision by the Swedish cabinet was made on the evening of January 10 in Stockholm, January 11 is recognized as the date in Vietnam because of the six-hour time difference in Hanoi.  &&&&& *U.S. Army Special Forces Reserve officer Robert Helmey used an unloaded shotgun to hijack United Airlines Flight 459 to Cuba, diverting it from its Jacksonville to Miami flight and forcing a landing in Havana. In a month with regular hijackings of U.S. flights, Helmey's case stands out because he was the first successful hijacker to be prosecuted in the United States. Immediately after he landed in Cuba, he was arrested by the Castro government and would spend 109 days in solitary confinement in a Cuban jail before being deported to Canada, which in turn would return him to American authorities on May 5. A jury would find him not guilty of all charges on November 20, accepting his defense of temporary insanity, making Helmey the first skyjacker of a commercial aircraft anywhere to be acquitted at trial.  &&&&& *U.S. Army First Lieutenant Harold A. Fritz distinguished himself in combat in the Vietnam War by leading the defense of his outnumbered 28-man platoon against a larger force of North Vietnamese attackers during two successive ambush attacks. Despite being seriously wounded in the first moments of the battle, Fritz inspired his men in leading the fight until American tanks were able to come to the platoon's rescue. He would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism on March 2, 1971. &&&&& &&&&& [[January 12]], 1969 (Sunday) &&&&& * The American Football League champion New York Jets, led by brash quarterback Joe Namath, upset the National Football League champion Baltimore Colts, 16 to 7, to win Super Bowl III in Miami.  Namath would later write that "The rewards and great memories for me come not only from being part of a team and a league that were overwhelmingly underdogs and winning it all, but equally because we lifted people's spirits in a very difficult time" in New York City and would add, "I have been told many times over the years that the Jets, and then the Mets and Knicks, helped people emotionally deal with all this adversity."  &&&&& * ''Led Zeppelin'', the first Led Zeppelin album, was released in the United States. &&&&& * Martial law was declared in Madrid, as the University was closed and over 300 students were arrested. &&&&& &&&&& [[January 13]], 1969 (Monday) &&&&& *Scandinavian Airlines Flight 933 plunged into the Santa Monica Bay off of the coast of California, drowning 15 of the 45 people on board. The Douglas DC-8 jet was making its approach to Los Angeles after departing from Seattle on a flight that had originated at Copenhagen in Denmark, and was nearly seven miles off course when it descended into the sea, impacting at 7:21 p.m. local time. Thirty survivors were able to evacuate on the airplane's life rafts.  &&&&& *'''Born:''' Stephen Hendry, Scottish professional snooker player and winner of seven world championships, including five in a row from 1992 to 1996; in South Queensferry &&&&& &&&&& [[January 14]], 1969 (Tuesday) &&&&& * An explosion aboard the aircraft carrier USS ''Enterprise'' near Hawaii killed 27 U.S. Navy men and injured 314.  The accident happened during operation of an aircraft engine starter unit and the placement of a cart with four Zuni rockets too close to the exhaust port of the starter unit.  The hot exhaust detonated one of the Zuni warheads, and the explosion sent shards of metal into the fuel tank of the F-4 Phantom that was being prepared for takeoff; the tank then exploded, causing a fire that ignited the other three Zuni rockets and then causing a chain reaction that set off other bombs and rockets as burning fuel spilled from the flight deck to the hangar deck.  &&&&& * The Soviet Union launched Soyuz 4, with cosmonaut Vladimir Shatalov, at 1:39 in the afternoon (07:39 UTC) from the Baikonur Space Center. For the first time since the Soviet space program had started, film of a rocket was shown on Soviet Union television on the same day that it happened. A video of Shatalov boarding the rocket, along with the last five minutes of the countdown, and the liftoff, was telecast within 90 minutes.  &&&&& *India's Madras State was formally renamed as Tamil Nadu.   &&&&& * American spy Morton Sobell was released from federal prison after serving 17 years of a 30 year sentence for conspiracy to sell atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union.

On board the second Soyuz were Boris V. Volyanov, Aleksei S. Yeliseyev and Yevgeny V. Khrunov.  The two ships docked the next day and made the first transfer ever of a Soviet cosmonaut from one craft to another as Khrunov and Yeliseyev joined Vladimir Shatalov on Soyuz 4.   &&&&& &&&&& [[January 16]], 1969 (Thursday) &&&&& *Student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

While American crews had performed the first docking of spaceships, the Gemini astronauts had always come back in the same vehicle that they had started with. Alexei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny V. Khrunov, sent up on Soyuz 5, landed safely (along with Vladimir Shatalov) in Soyuz 4 in the Kazahk SSR, about northwest of Karaganda (now Qaraghandy in the Republic of Kazakhstan.  &&&&& *An antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice was filed against International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), charging the company with monopolizing the digital computer industry, programming hindering competitors and limiting the development of the computer programming by its policy of selling its hardware, software and technical support as an inseparable package.

Substantive talks would not begin until a week later, after the inauguration of President Nixon. Lyndon Johnson, whose term as U.S. President would expire two days after the agreement on the tables, would write later that "I regretted more than anyone could possibly know that I was leaving the White House without having achieved a just, honorable, and a lasting peace in Vietnam."  &&&&& *'''Born:''' &&&&& **Jesse L.

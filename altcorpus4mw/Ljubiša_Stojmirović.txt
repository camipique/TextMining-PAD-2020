Ljubiša Stojmirović &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Ljubiša Stojmirović''' (; born September 11, 1950) is a politician in Serbia. He is currently serving his fourth term in the National Assembly of Serbia. Originally a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party, Stojmirović now serves with the Serbian Progressive Party. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and career &&&&& Stojmirović was born in Belgrade, then part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Organizational Sciences in 1978, focusing on organizational cybernetics. He subsequently received a master's degree from the same institution in 1980 and a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Mathematics in 1998. Stojmirović taught at the Central Economic School in Grocka from 1982 to 1985, worked for a time at the maritime agency ''Jugoagent'', began teaching at the Belgrade Business School in 2000, and became a full professor at the latter institution in 2005. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& ===Radical Party=== &&&&& Stojmirović joined the Radical Party in 1991, the year of the party's formation, and was a frequent candidate for public office in the 1990s. He sought election to the &&&&& Yugoslavian federal assembly's Chamber of Citizens in the May 1992 federal election, running in the single-member constituency of Mladenovac, and finished second against Radivoje Jovanović of the Socialist Party of Serbia. &&&&& &&&&& Stojmirović subsequently received the eighteenth position on the Radical Party's electoral list for Belgrade in the 1992 Serbian parliamentary election and the fourteenth position in the same division in the 1993 Serbian election. The Radicals won twelve seats in Belgrade in 1992 and seven in 1993, and Stojmirović was not selected for its assembly delegation on either occasion. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists by the sponsoring parties. It was common practice for the latter mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Stojmirović could have been awarded a mandate despite his relatively low position on the list; in the event, however, he was not.) &&&&& &&&&& He received the second position on the Radical Party's list for Voždovac in the 1996 Yugoslavian parliamentary election. The Radicals won only one seat in the division, and he was again not elected. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election, Stojmirović received the eighth position on the party's list in Čukarica. The party won four mandates in the division, and he was on this occasion included in its assembly delegation. The election was won by the Socialist Party of Serbia and its allies, and the Radicals originally served in opposition. From 1998 to 2000, the party participated in a coalition government with the Socialists and the Yugoslav Left. After the fall of Slobodan Milošević's administration in October 2000, a new transitional government was established that excluded the Radicals, and the party returned to opposition. &&&&& &&&&& Serbia's electoral system was reformed for the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, with the entire country becoming a single electoral constituency and all parliamentary mandates being awarded to sponsoring parties rather than to individual candidates on the successful lists. Stojmirović received the 202nd position out of 250 on the Radical Party's list, although in this circumstance his list position had no formal bearing on whether he would receive a mandate. The party won twenty-three seats, and he was not included in its assembly delegation. &&&&& &&&&& Stojmirović served as president (i.e., mayor) of the Belgrade municipality of Zvezdara from February to June 2005, in the context of a local alliance with the Democratic Party of Serbia, the Socialists, and other parties. He also sought election as chair of the Assembly of the City of Belgrade in November 2007, although he was not successful. &&&&& &&&&& He was also included on the Radical Party's electoral lists in the 2007 and 2008 parliamentary elections, although he was not included in its assembly delegation on either occasion. &&&&& &&&&& ===Progressive Party=== &&&&& The Radical Party experienced a serious split in late 2008, with several of its members joining the more moderate Serbian Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić. Stojmirović was among those who sided with the Progressives. &&&&& &&&&& Serbia's electoral system was reformed again in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Stojmirović received the thirty-fourth position on the Progressive Party's Let's Get Serbia Moving list for the 2012 parliamentary election and was elected when the list won seventy-three mandates. The Progressives formed a new coalition government with the Socialists and other parties after the election, and Stojmirović served in the assembly as a government supporter. He was re-elected in the 2014 and 2016 elections, in which the Progressive-led lists won landslide victories. &&&&& &&&&& Stojmirović is currently the deputy chair of the assembly's committee on education, science, technological development, and the information society; a member of the foreign affairs committee and of the European Union–Serbia stabilization and association parliamentary committee; the head of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Central European Initiative; the head of Serbia's parliamentary friendship group with Cuba; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Israel, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Russia, Tunisia, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. &&&&& &&&&& Electoral record &&&&& ===Federal (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& + '''May 1992 Yugoslavian Federal ElectionChamber of Citizens: Mladenovac''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Radivoje Jovanović &&&&& &&&&& Socialist Party of Serbia &&&&& &&&&& 25,224 &&&&& &&&&& 47.42 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ljubiša Stojmirović''' &&&&& &&&&& Serbian Radical Party &&&&& &&&&& 17,914 &&&&& &&&&& 33.68 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Radivoje Jašić &&&&& &&&&& League of Communists – Movement for Yugoslavia &&&&& &&&&& 5,959 &&&&& &&&&& 11.20 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Predrag Kovačević &&&&& &&&&& Citizens' Group &&&&& &&&&& 4,094 &&&&& &&&&& 7.70 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Total valid votes &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  53,191 &&&&& &&&&& 100 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

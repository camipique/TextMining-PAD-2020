Deathwatch (1965 film) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Deathwatch''''' is a 1965 drama film directed by Vic Morrow. It is an adaptation of the French play ''Haute Surveillance'' by Jean Genet. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Greeneyes and Emil are in prison awaiting their death sentences to be carried out by guillotine. The jewel thief Lefranc and hoodlum Maurice are imprisoned for less serious crimes but must align themselves with tougher inmates for their own survival in prison. They both seek to get closer to Greeneyes, leading to conflict between them. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& *Leonard Nimoy - Lefranc &&&&& *Michael Forest - Greeneyes &&&&& *Paul Mazursky - Maurice &&&&& *Robert Ellenstein - Guard &&&&& *Gavin MacLeod - Emil &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& Vic Morrow had played Lefranc in the first New York production of ''Deathwatch'' in 1958. The three actors Leonard Nimoy, Paul Mazursky, and Michael Forest had already staged a version of the play in 1959. &&&&& &&&&& Vic Morrow announced he wanted to make the film back in December 1960. He said his dream cast would include Cornel Wilde, Dan Duryea and George Hamilton. &&&&& &&&&& The ''New York Times'' printed that Vic Morrow and Leonard Nimoy had acquired the movie rights to the play in the issue published November 27, 1962. Leonard Nimoy obtained the rights to film ''Haute Surveillance'' directly from Genet, though Genet had no further involvement with the project. &&&&& &&&&& The screenplay was adapted by Morrow and his then-wife Barbara Turner. Part of ''Deathwatch'' was shot in the nineteenth-century Nevada State Prison, where the actors lived for six months to prepare for their roles. Some of the inmates took part in the production. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& The film was first shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1965 but it was not given a general release nor was it widely reviewed. It was later given a limited release in the USA in March 1966. One of the first films to be directly marketed to a gay audience, ''Deathwatch'' was quickly buried in the States and never released in the UK. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& In a review years later, a reviewer for the ''San Francisco Bay Guardian'' wrote that in "the feature, adapted from a Genet play, which has been unjustly forgotten for 23 years, Vic Morrow’s direction captures a consistent, if not very interesting, mood, and the editing seems ahead of its time in the way flashbacks are inserted. Leonard Nimoy and Michael Forest are the butch guys sharing a cell with nellie Paul Mazursky in this unromantic triangle that’s hard to tear your eyes away from, even if it’s not very good." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

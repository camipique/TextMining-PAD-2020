Langley Hill Doppler radar &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Langley Hill radar in August, 2011 &&&&& The '''Langley Hill Doppler radar''' (KLGX) is a National Weather Service NEXRAD Doppler weather radar station on the Pacific coast of Washington State, in the United States. Prior to its construction, Washington's Olympic Peninsula coast was the only portion of the U.S. coastline without weather radar coverage, and there was "virtually no radar coverage is available over the ocean, where the majority of western Washington's weather originates" according to a Weather Service report to the United States Congress. Its location was announced in early 2011, construction started in March, and the unit was commissioned in September, 2011. A major motivation for the station was early detection of Pacific Northwest windstorms; a proponent, Professor Cliff Mass of the University of Washington, said it would provide an additional 6 to 12 hour storm warning to residents of the Pacific Northwest. &&&&& &&&&& Location &&&&& The radar dome, the first on Washington's coast, is on a steel tower atop a high hill between Copalis Beach and Copalis Crossing, off State Route 109. Prior to its construction, coastal coverage from the nearest radar at Camano Island on Puget Sound was limited by the Olympic Mountains. This radar (longitude 124.107° west) and KBHX at the Lost Coast near Eureka, California () were the westernmost weather radars in the continental United States as of 2013. &&&&& &&&&& Technology &&&&& One of the system's first images during checkout in August, 2011. Salish Sea and Vancouver Island near top of frame; entire Washington coast inside inner circle; central Oregon coast near bottom. &&&&& The radar is a NEXRAD WSR‐88D, and was one of the first in the nation to be upgraded to dual polarization capability on September 21, 2011. It is the only operational WSR-88D that scans as low as 0.2 degrees above the horizon, which sometimes causes image artifacts due to sea clutter. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * (National Weather Service live data) &&&&& * Langley Hill Coastal Radar: The Latest Addition to the National Weather Service Doppler Radar Network, University of Washington Department of Atmospheric Sciences &&&&& *, video by ''The Oregonian'' newspaper (Portland) &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

127	Euploca
Euploca &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Euploca''''' is an almost cosmopolitan genus of plants with around 100 species. It was first described by Thomas Nuttall in 1837. While part of the broadly defined Boraginaceae in the APG IV system from 2016, a revision of the order Boraginales from the same year includes ''Euploca'' in the separate family Heliotropiaceae. Its species used to be classified in the genera ''Hilgeria'' and ''Schleidenia'' and in ''Heliotropium'' sect. ''Orthostachys'', but were found to form an independent lineage in a molecular phylogenetic analysis, more closely related to ''Myriopus'' than to ''Heliotropium''. While many species use the photosynthetic pathway, there are also â€“ intermediate species. Species have leaves with a -typical Kranz anatomy. &&&&& &&&&& Selected species: &&&&& *''E. convolvulacea'' (sweet-scented heliotrope, showy heliotrope) &&&&& *''E. filiformis'' &&&&& *''E. salicoides'' &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

163	Guilalo
Guilalo &&&&& Introduction &&&&& ''Guilalo'' ships in Manila Bay, in a woodcut in Frank Marryat's ''Borneo and the Indian Archipelago'' (1848) &&&&& '''''Guilalo''''' (also spelled '''''gilalo''''', '''''jilalo''''', '''''bilalo''''', or '''''guil√°las'''''), were large native sailing outrigger ships of the Tagalog people in the Philippines. They were common vessels in Manila Bay in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were easily identifiable by their two large settee sails made with woven fiber. They were steered by a central rudder and can be rowed with round-bladed oars. &&&&& &&&&& They ferried passengers and trade goods (like dried fish and fruits) between Manila and Cavite. They were also used in the Batangas region. &&&&& &&&&& They were also sometimes referred to as ''tafurea'' (or ''tarida'') in Spanish, due to their similarity in appearance to the Medieval European ''tafurea'', a flat-bottomed sailing ship used to transport horses. They were also sometimes confused with the "''panco''" of the Southern Philippines. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Balangay &&&&& *Casco (barge) &&&&& *Garay (ship) &&&&& *Karakoa &&&&& *Paraw &&&&& *Salambaw &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

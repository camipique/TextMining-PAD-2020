List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& National Firefighters Memorial, Cannon Street, London &&&&& This article is a list of '''British firefighters killed in the line of duty''' since 1900. As such, it only lists those firefighters killed or who sustained injuries from which they subsequently died whilst on duty and not those who were off-duty at the time of the event at which they died. It also does not list the 997 firefighters killed during the Second World War, nor any deaths relating to The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Military firefighter personnel are only listed if they died during non-combatant fires or accidents. Some links to the original fire authority areas may link to the present day authority that covers the geographic area. &&&&& &&&&& For example, the West Riding Fire Service became the West Yorkshire Fire Service in 1974, and during this process parts of the former West Riding of Yorkshire area became part of East Yorkshire (Humberside Fire and Rescue Service),Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester. See History of fire brigades in the United Kingdom &&&&& &&&&& During the period between 1941 and 1947, all fire brigades in Britain were amalgamated into the National Fire Service (NFS). This totalled over 1,600 individual brigades. Some links that point to the NFS may actually link to the fire service that covers the present day geographical area. When the NFS was broken up, it was decided that local county authority control would be the natural way to divide the brigades. This left Essex with one brigade covering the ceremonial county and Southend, which was a county borough, with its own independent fire service. &&&&& &&&&& As more than one firefighter has died at certain incidents, some listings for dead firefighters may refer to the first alphabetical entry from that event. Certain brigades may have been subsumed into other services (Bradford Fire Brigade into West Yorkshire) or completely dissolved altogether, such as the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Fire Brigade. &&&&& &&&&& The Firefighter's Prayer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& List &&&&& ===A–G=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& &&&&& Age &&&&& &&&&& Brigade &&&&& &&&&& Role &&&&& &&&&& Date of incident &&&&& &&&&& Circumstances &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& James Allan &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 28 March 1960 &&&&& &&&&& The Cheapside Street whisky bond fire. Allan, along with 13 other Glasgow Fire Service colleagues and five from the Glasgow Salvage Corps, were killed at the whisky bond warehouse owned by Arbuckle, Smith & Co. Over a of alcohol was stored on the site and a combination of secure-proof building design and narrow streets hampered the efforts of the firefighters. As the alcohol was superheated, a massive explosion ruptured the walls outwards and covered the firefighters on two different streets with falling masonry; one turntable ladder and its crew were completely covered in rubble. 19 firefighters died in all, in what was described as Britain's worst firefighter disaster since the Second World War. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Derek George William Andrews &&&&& &&&&& 32 &&&&& &&&&& City of Birmingham Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 25 August 1972 &&&&& &&&&& Andrews was fighting a factory fire in Tenby street when the building collapsed onto him. He received fatal injuries. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& John Appleby &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& London Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 13 July 1969 &&&&& &&&&& The Dudgeon's Wharf Explosion; the London Fire Brigade had been called out to a tank farm on the Isle of Dogs in East London when one of the tanks being demolished caught fire. Whilst five firemen were atop the structure trying to pour water in from the top to cool the tank, a worker on the site used a cutting torch to remove an inspection plate at the base of the tank. A spark from the torch ignited the air/gas mix and the tank exploded killing the five firemen and the civilian torch-cutter. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& John Averis &&&&& &&&&& 27 &&&&& &&&&& Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 2 November 2007 &&&&& &&&&& The 2007 Warwickshire warehouse fire; A fire broke out at a vegetable packing warehouse near to Atherstone-on-Stour in Warwickshire in November 2007. Averis and two colleagues, Ashley Stephens and Darren Yates-Bradley, were not recovered for four days afterwards due to the instability of the structure after it had collapsed. A fourth colleague, Ian Reid, was pulled from the burning building alive, but died later in hospital. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ian Bagshaw &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Royal Air Force Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 14 March 1986 &&&&& &&&&& Bagshaw, a Senior Aircraftman in the Royal Air Force, died when the emergency vehicle he was in crashed in Lincolnshire. He was serving at RAF Waddington at the time. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Alan Bannon &&&&& &&&&& 38 &&&&& &&&&& Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 6 April 2010 &&&&& &&&&& Bannon and a colleague were responding to a fire in a tower block in Southampton. Firefighters had difficulties fighting the fire and the coroner's report stated that Bannon and Shears had died after being exposed to "sudden exposure to initially intense heat from 20.38 to 20.41 and thereafter to excessive heat while dealing with a fire in a flat on the 9th floor of the high-rise tower block Shirley Towers". &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& David Barnes &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 15 September 1977 &&&&& &&&&& Barnes was engaged in fighting a fire in Elgar Road, Reading, when the building collapsed onto him. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& George William Barrett &&&&& &&&&& 43 &&&&& &&&&& West Midlands Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 2 December 1976 &&&&& &&&&& Barrett was killed in a vehicle accident whilst en route to a fire inspection. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Robert Bell &&&&& &&&&& 29 &&&&& &&&&& Kent Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 8 November 1974 &&&&& &&&&& Bell and another firefighter, David Holley, were investigating smoke in a building full of latex mattresses on HMS Pembroke in Chatham Dockyard. It was believed that a flashover occurred and killed the men outright, but it was not known exactly what caused the flashover that resulted in their deaths. Investigations by the Fire Research Station later determined that a smouldering cigarette could cause latex to decompose at low temperatures and allow flammable fumes to accumulate. It was assumed that whilst searching for the seat of the fire, the two firemen turned over one of the smouldering mattresses which allowed an explosive mix of air and flammable vapour to mix and thereby cause an explosion. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Iain Bermingham &&&&& &&&&& 29 &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 25 August 1972 &&&&& &&&&& The Kilbirnie Street fire; Bermingham and five others had gone into a burning building to recover a missing fireman at a cash and carry warehouse on Kilbirnie Street in Glasgow. Fireman Rook was listed as missing and as the six-man team were trying to recover him, an extreme flashover event that caused the temperature to be instantly raised to over occurred and all seven died. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Joseph Edmund Binns &&&&& &&&&& 29 &&&&& &&&&& Bradford Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 21 August 1916 &&&&& &&&&& The Low Moor Explosion; Binns, along with five colleagues and a firefighter from a railway company, died as a result of a massive explosion at the Low Moor Munitions plant, Low Moor, Bradford, West Yorkshire in August 1916. The seven were killed during an attempt to control a fire which resulted in the explosion. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Christopher Boyle &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 28 March 1960 &&&&& &&&&& See listing under James Allan. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Hylton Brearley &&&&& &&&&& 37 &&&&& &&&&& West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 9 December 1976 &&&&& &&&&& Brearley was killed in Netherton when the appliance that he was in overturned on ice whilst en route to a callout. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Terence Breen &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& London Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 13 July 1969 &&&&& &&&&& The Dudgeon's Wharf Explosion; see listing under John Appleby &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Eli Buckley &&&&& &&&&& 29 &&&&& &&&&& Bradford Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 21 August 1916 &&&&& &&&&& The Low Moor Explosion; see Joseph Edmund Binns &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& J Buist &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Angus Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 13 April 1962 &&&&& &&&&& Buist, a Divisional Officer, was killed when a bale of jute fell on him whilst tackling a fire in Dundee. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Robert Burrows &&&&& &&&&& 25 &&&&& &&&&& Salford Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 1 March 1951 &&&&& &&&&& Burrows and his crew were on their way to a call in Weaste on the west side of Salford. The fire appliance they were on was a type where the firefighters rode along the outside of the vehicle and held on to a handrail. Whilst en route, the handrail snapped, Burrows and a colleague fell into the road where Burrows sustained head injuries and died. Investigations later determined that water penetration had rotted the wood where the screws affixed it to the appliance. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Edmund Burt &&&&& &&&&& 23 &&&&& &&&&& Western Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 7 October 1968 &&&&& &&&&& Firefighters from the Western Fire Brigade (later Strathclyde), had brought a fire at a papermill in Linwood under control when a wall collapsed and buried four people. Burt died from injuries sustained by falling masonry. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& J Calderwood &&&&& &&&&& 58 &&&&& &&&&& Lanarkshire Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 7 January 1963 &&&&& &&&&& Calderwood and a colleague, McIntosh, were fighting a fire in a paint store at Colville's Steel Works in Bellshill, Mossend.

They would entertain a crowd inside the house and deliberately set a small fire from which everyone could escape, then initiate a larger fire so that the brigade could demonstrate their skills in putting the fire out. On this occasion the larger fire was started before the evacuation had taken place and three firemen and 12 boys from the local Sea Cadet troop died. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ian Robert Collier &&&&& &&&&& 22 &&&&& &&&&& West Midlands Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 29 May 1977 &&&&& &&&&& Collier was fighting a fire on a railway embankment in Solihull.

Dean suffered a fatal heart attack. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Reginald Deveson &&&&& &&&&& 56 &&&&& &&&&& Kent Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& R &&&&& &&&&& 11 May 1965 &&&&& &&&&& Deveson was helping to put out a fire aboard a ship carrying jute and oil-cake stranded on Deal beach. He had already been at the scene for sometime when he said he was feeling unwell, by the time that a doctor had arrived on the Walmer lifeboat, Deveson had passed away. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Alfred Dickinson &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 28 March 1960 &&&&& &&&&& See listing under James Allan. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Gordon Robert Dix &&&&& &&&&& 52 &&&&& &&&&& Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 16 February 1966 &&&&& &&&&& Dix and two colleagues died when they were overcome by smoke at a bunker on RAF Neatishead in Norfolk. The fire had been started deliberately and caused over one and half million pounds worth of damage. Because of the potential for confusion in smoke or complicated building layouts, a knotted guide line was introduced nationally after this fire to assist firefighters to identify the correct way to the exit. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& John Donley &&&&& &&&&& 26 &&&&& &&&&& County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 5 September 1982 &&&&& &&&&& Donley and his colleague, Tony Hall, were killed when their fire engine overturned en route to a chimney fire in South Hetton. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Morrison Dunbar &&&&& &&&&& 23 &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 24 December 1927 &&&&& &&&&& See listing under James Conn &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Herbert James Durrant &&&&& &&&&& 52 &&&&& &&&&& Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 16 February 1966 &&&&& &&&&& The RAF Neatishead fire, see listing under Gordon Robert Dix. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Albert Farrow &&&&& &&&&& 44 &&&&& &&&&& Kent Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& R &&&&& &&&&& 29 November 1957 &&&&& &&&&& A fire had engulfed the tailor's shop at Oakwood Hospital in Maidstone.

An inquest into their deaths later stated that fire officers had not realised the strength of the flames and that a hose had been burnt through. It was also suggested that when colleagues opened doors to vent the building, a flashover occurred and burnt the men to death. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Allan Finlay &&&&& &&&&& 20 &&&&& &&&&& Glasgow Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 25 August 1972 &&&&& &&&&& See Iain Bermingham. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Dennis Michael Flint &&&&& &&&&& 32 &&&&& &&&&& West Midlands Fire Service &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 22 September 1983 &&&&& &&&&& Flint was attempting to fight a fire in a paper factory in Nechells, Birmingham, when a bale of paper fell on his head and he sustained fatal injuries. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Jack Fourt-Wells &&&&& &&&&& 46 &&&&& &&&&& London Fire Brigade &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& 23 January 1958 &&&&& &&&&& Smithfield Poultry Market in the Smithfield district of London, burnt down in January 1958.

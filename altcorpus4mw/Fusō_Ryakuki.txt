Fusō Ryakuki &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''''Fusō Ryakuki''''' (扶桑略記) is a Japanese historical text compiled at the end of the twelfth century. It is also called the '''''Fusō-ki''''' (扶桑記) or '''''Fusō-shū''''' (扶桑集). &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& The ''Fusō Ryakuki'' is a Japanese historical text compiled at the end of the Heian period. It is also called the ''Fusō-ki'' or ''Fusō-shū''. It was compiled by the Enryaku-ji monk , who died in 1169. It is written in ''kanbun'', in an annal style. &&&&& &&&&& According to the '''', it was originally in thirty books, but of these only books 2 through 6 (Empress Jingū to Emperor Shōmu) and 20 through 30 (Emperor Yōzei to Emperor Horikawa), or sixteen books in total, are extant. The complete work originally chronicled Japan's history from the reign of Emperor Jinmu in the seventh century BCE to Kanji 8 (1094 CE). Using surviving extracts, however, the ''Ryakuki''s accounts of the reigns of Emperor Jinmu through Emperor Heizei can be reconstructed to some extent. &&&&& &&&&& It utilizes the ''Six National Histories'', as well as diaries, ''engi'', biographies of famous monks (僧伝 ''sōden'') and temple traditions to construct a narrative history of Japan, with a particular emphasis on topics of Buddhist interest. It supposedly also included an account of the age of the gods, but this has not survived and its contents are unknown. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& === Citations === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& === Works cited === &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

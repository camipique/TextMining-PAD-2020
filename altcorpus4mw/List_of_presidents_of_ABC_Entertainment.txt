List of presidents of ABC Entertainment &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The following is a list of presidents of the entertainment division for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Prior to the mid 1970s, the role was essentially filled under the title '''Vice presidents of Programs'''. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Name &&&&& &&&&& Years &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& James T. Aubrey &&&&& &&&&& March 1957 – April 28, 1958 &&&&& &&&&& As vice president in charge of programs (a title he gained before March 1957), he brought to the air what he recalled as "wild, sexy, lively stuff, things that had never been done before," shows such as ''Maverick'', a western with James Garner, and ''77 Sunset Strip'', a detective show with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (However, by the time ''Strip'' went on the air in October 1958, Aubrey had already left the network.) Oulahan and Lambert said Aubrey scheduled "one lucrative show after another ... and for the first time the third network became a serious challenge to NBC and CBS." Among the successes he scheduled were ''The Donna Reed Show'', a domestic comedy; ''The Rifleman'', a western with Chuck Connors; and ''The Real McCoys'', a rural comedy with Walter Brennan and Richard Crenna. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Thomas W. Moore &&&&& &&&&& 1956–1957 &&&&& &&&&& Among the shows aired during this time were ''The Real McCoys'', ''77 Sunset Strip'', ''My Three Sons'', ''The Flintstones'', ''Ben Casey'', and ''The Untouchables''. While he was network president, the network added, among other shows, ''McHale's Navy'', ''Peyton Place'', ''The Addams Family'' and ''Batman''. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Edgar Scherick &&&&& &&&&& June 1963–1966 &&&&& &&&&& In June 1963, Scherick became Vice President of Programming for the ABC Television Network, where he created many popular shows including ''Bewitched'', ''Batman'', ''That Girl'', ''The Hollywood Palace'', and ''Peyton Place''. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Leonard Goldberg &&&&& &&&&& 1966–1969 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Martin Starger &&&&& &&&&& 1969–1972; 1972–1975 &&&&& &&&&& He led ABC during its boom period in the 1970s, pioneering the creation of television shows such as ''ABC Movie of the Week'', ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' and ''Happy Days''. He also pushed the limits of television broadcast presiding over pioneering miniseries and specials such as ''Roots'' and ''Rich Man, Poor Man''.  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Barry Diller &&&&& &&&&& 1973–1974 &&&&& &&&&& He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC, who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City. Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ''ABC Movie of the Week'', pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Fred Silverman &&&&& &&&&& 1975–1978 &&&&& &&&&& Silverman was named president of ABC Entertainment in 1975, putting him in the awkward position of saving ''Happy Days'', the very show that ''Good Times'' had brought to the brink of cancellation. Silverman succeeded in bringing ''Happy Days'' to the top of the ratings and generating a hit spin-off from that show, ''Laverne & Shirley''. At ABC, Silverman also greenlit other popular series such as ''The Bionic Woman'' (a ''Six Million Dollar Man'' spin-off), ''Family'', ''Charlie's Angels'', ''Donny & Marie'', ''Three's Company'', ''Eight Is Enough'', ''The Love Boat'', ''Soap'', ''Fantasy Island'', ''Good Morning America'', long form pioneer ''Rich Man, Poor Man'' and the award-winning miniseries, ''Roots''. These moves brought ABC's long-dormant ratings from third place to first place. However, Silverman was criticized during this period for relying heavily on escapist fare (it was Silverman who conceived the infamous ''The Brady Bunch Hour'' with Sid and Marty Krofft in late 1976) and for bringing T&A or "jiggle TV" to the small screen with numerous ABC shows featuring buxom, attractive, and often scantily-clad young women (such as the popular ''Battle of the Network Stars''). ABC Daytime had mediocre ratings, so in order to increase them, Silverman hired Gloria Monty to produce the ailing ''General Hospital''. He gave Monty thirteen weeks to increase the serial's ratings or it would be cancelled. He later expanded ''General Hospital'' and ''One Life to Live'' to a full hour, and created a 3 hour afternoon serial block. Among game shows, Silverman introduced Goodson-Todman's ''Family Feud'' to the network. During Silverman's time at ABC, he overhauled the network's Saturday-morning cartoon output, dumping Filmation (which had produced the failed ''Uncle Croc's Block'') and replacing it with content from Hanna-Barbera, including a continuation of ''Scooby-Doo''. ABC abandoned the wiping of video-taped programs under Silverman's watch in 1978, as CBS had done while he was at that network. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Anthony Thomopoulos &&&&& &&&&& 1978–1983 &&&&& &&&&& His big break came in 1973, when Barry Diller hired him on at ABC to oversee prime-time programming. He was noted, among other things, for the tough position he took in dealing with the contract holdout of Suzanne Somers on the hit ABC show ''Three's Company'', and for his quick cancellation of the 1982 cult favorite ''Police Squad!'', explaining that the show had been cancelled because, among other reasons, "it required constant attention".  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Lewis Erlicht &&&&& &&&&& 1983 – November 1985 &&&&& &&&&& After seeing Emmanuel Lewis in a Burger King commercial, ABC's programming chief, Lew Erlicht, wanted to give the actor his own series. At this time, ''Another Ballgame'' creator Stu Silver desired to develop an original show based on the lead characters portrayed by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the film ''Woman of the Year'' and saw Alex Karras and Susan Clark's on-screen chemistry as being strikingly reminiscent of this. The network felt the need to cast Lewis in a project quickly, before he grew another inch (like child actor Gary Coleman, who was also small for his age, Lewis would end up at 4'3".) With the number of comedy pilots ABC had greenlit for that fall's schedule, it was likely that Lewis would not be able to get his own series and timeslot unless he was worked into already-existing comedy projects. So, among others shows, co-producers on ''Another Ballgame'' were approached about working Lewis into the show. Stars Karras and Clark liked the idea of the sudden marriage and instant adoption of a young black boy, and the Webster character was thus created. ''Moonlighting'' was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, one of the producers of the similar ''Remington Steele'', when he was approached by Erlicht. Erlicht liked the work Caron had done on ''Taxi'' and ''Remington Steele'' and wanted a detective show featuring a major star in a leading role who would appeal to an upscale audience. Caron wanted to do a romance, to which Erlicht replied "I don't care what it is, as long as it's a detective show.” &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Brandon Stoddard &&&&& &&&&& 1985–1989 &&&&& &&&&& During his tenure as the head of ABC entertainment shows such as ''Roseanne'', ''The Wonder Years'' and ''Thirtysomething'' were created. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bob Iger &&&&& &&&&& 1989–1992 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ted Harbert &&&&& &&&&& 1992–1996 &&&&& &&&&& At ABC, Harbert was closely associated with groundbreaking programs such as ''The Wonder Years'',''NYPD Blue'',''The Practice'', and ''My So Called Life'', among many others, and, during his tenure, ABC moved to the top in primetime programs in 1995 for the first time in 17 years, and led all the networks in profits for several years. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Jamie Tarses &&&&& &&&&& 1996–1999 &&&&& &&&&& Tarses was the first woman and one of the youngest people to hold such a post in an American broadcast network. Tarses was the subject of a noteworthy "unflattering profile" written by Lynn Hirschberg in the ''New York Times Magazine'' in July 1997 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Stuart Bloomberg &&&&& &&&&& 1999 – January 2002 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Susan M. Lyne &&&&& &&&&& January 2002 – May 2004 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Lloyd Braun &&&&& &&&&& 2002 – November 2004 &&&&& &&&&& Braun was forced out of his position at ABC shortly after greenlighting the $13 million pilot to the television show ''Lost'', one of the most expensive in modern broadcasting. His decision was vindicated, however, when the show went on to become a huge success. Braun and his partner, Susan Lyne, also greenlit other ABC shows that went on to great success in the years following his dismissal, including ''Desperate Housewives'', ''Extreme Makeover Home Edition'', ''Boston Legal'' and ''Grey's Anatomy''. These shows began an unprecedented turnaround for ABC. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Stephen McPherson &&&&& &&&&& 2004 – July 2010 &&&&& &&&&& With relatively little buzz surrounding its 2010–11 pilots, compounded by a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, Stephen McPherson resigned as ABC Entertainment Group president on July 27, 2010. Paul Lee (who previously served as the president of sister cable channel ABC Family) was announced as his replacement that same day. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Paul Lee &&&&& &&&&& 2010 – February 2016 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Channing Dungey &&&&& &&&&& 2016–2018 &&&&& &&&&& Dungey was hired as president on February 17, 2016, replacing Paul Lee. Dungey oversaw the development of ABC Studio shows such as ''Scandal'', ''Criminal Minds'', ''How to Get Away with Murder'', ''Nashville'', ''Quantico'', ''Army Wives'' and ''Once Upon A Time'', as well as the second cancellation of ''Roseanne'' on May 29, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Karey Burke &&&&& &&&&& 2018–present &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of programs broadcast by American Broadcasting Company &&&&& *List of management of The Walt Disney Company &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

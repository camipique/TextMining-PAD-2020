Esther Forero &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Esther Forero Celis''' (10 December 1919 – 3 June 2011), better known as '''Esthercita Forero''' or "'''La Novia de Barranquilla'''" ("Barranquilla's Darling"), was a Colombian singer and composer. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& Esther Forero (also known as Estercita Forero) began to sing at age 4 at family gatherings and theaters of her hometown, Barranquilla. At the age of 14, she made her debut in a radio station named "La Voz de Barranquilla" (The Voice of Barranquilla.) Four years later she toured throughout the Colombian territory. In Bogotá (Colombian capital) she performed at and in other theaters, and radio stations. &&&&& &&&&& International success &&&&& In 1942, Forero made her first tour abroad. In Panama, she performed with success on "Radio Estrella de Panamá" (Panamanian radio station), with the accompaniment of pianist and composer, Avelino Muñoz. In 1945, she went to Venezuela where she first popularized the music of the Caribbean coast. She traveled to Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), where she wrote her first song entitled "Santo Domingo", and the porro (a Colombian cumbia rhythm that developed into its own subgenre) "Pegadita de los hombres", which became a hit and sold 80,000 copies for three consecutive years. Around 1950, she recorded a very successful album in Puerto Rico with composer Rafael Hernández, which contributed to Colombian music finding an opening among other popular expressions of the Caribbean. &&&&& &&&&& In Cuba, she performed with Pancho Portuondo's orchestra, followed in 1952 by a trip to New York, where her songs were widely known by several fans, and she started recording with pianist and composer René Touzet. &&&&& &&&&& Return to Colombia &&&&& Esther had two children, a son, Marcos Gonzalez, and a daughter named Esther Nouel. Her older son, Marcos, died at a young age, apparently having been stabbed to death; this was a loss that would always be in her mind as Marcos's son would also pass away in similar circumstances. Forero had a relationship with Bonairean sound engineer Gustavo Nouel (1907-?) with whom she had one daughter when she was 25 or 26 years old. Her daughter, also named Esther, was matriculated into a school for girls and stayed mostly there as her Mother immersed herself into her musical endeavors possibly favoring that over her personal family life. Esther and her daughter had a personal fallout lasting several decades but, were reconciled in Esther's latter years before her passing.. &&&&& &&&&& Esther Forero returned to Colombia in 1959, after 10 years of spreading the country's Caribbean music abroad. She began recording her music with orchestras such as those of Pacho Galán, Nuncira Machado, Aníbal Velásquez (es), and Clímaco Sarmiento, with singers including Gabriel Romero (es), Joe Arroyo, and Alfredo Gutiérrez &&&&& &&&&& At Esthercita's initiative, in 1974, a lost tradition of Barranquilla's Carnival was rescued – that of performing nightly parades with Cumbiambas (a folkloric rhythm and dance from Colombia) and tamboras(a percussion instrument that originated in the Dominican Republic made or recycled barrels and is played using 2 headed drums.) This night festival became known as La Guacherna. &&&&& &&&&& In 1975, she recorded ''Érase una vez en La Arenosa'' ("Once upon a time in the sandy city") ("Arenosa" being an endearing term for Barranquilla and the local sands), under the baton of maestro Pedro "Pete" Vicentini and accompanied by singer Alci Acosta. This recording tells the city's story in songs, and became an integral part of its culture. &&&&& &&&&& Recognitions &&&&& Plaza Esthercita Forero in Barranquilla &&&&& Throughout her life Forero, received honors from many Latin American communities. She received innumerable tributes, medals, parchments, plaques, and trophies, in recognition of work done as an ambassador of Colombian music to the world. As a result, the Society of Authors and Composers of Colombia awarded her with the Order of "Santa Cecilia." &&&&& &&&&& In 1998, the Ministry of Culture granted her the title Emérito 1998, "For her unquestionable contribution to Colombian music before the world, for her dedicated work, and for having been a spokesperson for the most positive values of our culture in the world." Subsequently, the House of Representatives granted her the Order "Policarpa Salavarrieta", with the rank of Commander. &&&&& &&&&& Songs &&&&& Esthercita Forero sang to her land in an endearing and nostalgic way. Her songs are part of the Barranquillan collective imagination and have deeply penetrated the identity of its inhabitants, who recognize and revere them as popular anthems. She was the author of well-known and accepted songs such as "Mi vieja Barranquilla" (My Old Barranquilla) (1974), "Luna Barranquillera" (Barranquillan Moon) (1963), "La Guacherna" (1976), "Volvió Juanita" (Juanita Returned) (1978), "Palito 'e matarratón" (1964), "Tambores de Carnaval" (Carnival Drums) (1978), "Nadie ha de saber" (No one should know) (2002), and "El hombre del palo" (The Wooden Man). &&&&& &&&&& Death &&&&& Esther Forero died on Friday, 3 June 2011 at age 91 at La Asunción Clinic in Barranquilla, after complications in several organs. She arrived at the clinic on Wednesday, 11 May 2011 with a shoulder dislocation, which later led to convulsions and cerebral ischemia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Family tree at SoloGenealogia &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

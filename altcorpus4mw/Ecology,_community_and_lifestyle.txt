Ecology, community and lifestyle &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Ecology, community and lifestyle: outline of an ecosophy''''' is a 1989 book about environmental philosophy by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss, writing with the philosopher David Rothenberg. &&&&& &&&&& Summary &&&&& &&&&& Naess advocates that the people should limit their numbers and "live in an enduring, dynamic equilibrium with other forms of life." &&&&& &&&&& Publication history &&&&& ''Ecology, community and lifestyle'' was first published in 1989 by Cambridge University Press. According to Rothenberg, the work was "not a direct translation of Arne Naess' 1976 work ''Økologi, samfunn, og livsstil'', but rather a new work in English, based on the Norwegian, with many sections revised and rewritten by Professor Naess and myself, in an attempt to clarify the original work as well as bring it up to date." &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& ''Ecology, community and lifestyle'' was reviewed by Robert P. McIntosh in ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', Jim Cheney in ''Environmental Ethics'', and the political scientist Charles T. Rubin in ''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy''. The book was also reviewed in the ''Journal of Applied Ecology''. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Deep ecology &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Bibliography=== &&&&& ;Books &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ;Journals &&&&& &&&&& *  &&&&& *  &&&&& *  &&&&& *  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

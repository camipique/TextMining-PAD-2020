Learning health systems &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Learning health systems''' (LHS) are healthcare systems in which knowledge generation processes are embedded in daily practice to produce continual improve in care. &&&&& &&&&& The idea was first conceptualised in a 2007 workshop organised by the US Institute of Medicine, building on ideas around evidence-based medicine and "practice-based evidence". There has since been increasing interest in the topic, including the creation of the Wiley journal ''Learning Health Systems''. &&&&& &&&&& LHS can be described as having four key elements: &&&&& #an organisational architecture that supports the formation of communities of patients, healthcare professionals and researchers who collaborate to produce and use "big data"; &&&&& #large electronic health data sets, ''i.e.'' "big data"; &&&&& #quality improvement at the point of care for each patient using new knowledge generated by research; &&&&& #research done in routine healthcare settings. &&&&& &&&&& They are thus dependent on the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and have inherited the adoption challenges of EHRs. &&&&& &&&&& LHS entail a clinical lifecycle. Patient data is collected, it is amalgamated across multiple patients and a problem is defined. These are activities largely driven by healthcare professionals. With the support of technology, an analysis is performed, which returns evidence, from which knowledge is generated, which leads to changed clinical practice, and thus to new patient data being collected. &&&&& &&&&& McLachlan and colleagues (2018) suggest a taxonomy of nine LHS classification types: &&&&& #Cohort identification looks for patients with similar attributes. &&&&& #Positive deviance finds examples of better care against a benchmark. &&&&& #Negative deviance finds examples of sub-optimal care. &&&&& #Predictive patient risk modelling uses patterns in data to find groups at greater risk of adverse events. &&&&& #Predictive care risk and outcome models identify situations that are at greater risk of poor care. &&&&& #Clinical decision support systems use patient algorithms applied to patient data to make specific treatment recommendations. &&&&& #Comparative effectiveness research determines the most effective treatments. &&&&& #Intelligent assistance use data to automate routine processes. &&&&& #Surveillance monitors data for disease outbreaks or other treatment issues. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Real World Evidence &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

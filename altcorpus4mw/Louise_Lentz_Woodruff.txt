The sculpture, known as Science Advancing Mankind, depicted an abstract robot form nudging a male and female figure forward, which exemplified the fair's themes of scientific and technological progress. After the fair, in 1935, she donated the sculpture to Joliet Township High School, now Joliet Central High School, where students dubbed it the "Steelman" and it served as the school team name and mascot.350px &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& *Louise Lentz Woodruff standing in front of Science Advancing Mankind &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

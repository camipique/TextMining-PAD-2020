Harrogate Theatre &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Harrogate Theatre''' is a Grade II listed performance hall and theatre, located in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. It is a full hemp house theatre that uses a theatrical rigging system to fly components like curtains, lights and scenery on and off the stage. &&&&& &&&&& A brown plaque is displayed outside the theatre paying tribute to some of the famous performers who have appeared on Harrogate Theatre's stage, including Sarah Bernhardt, Charlie Chaplin, Trevor Howard, George Robey, Ellen Terry, Fats Waller, Ken Dodd, Ben Kingsley and Eddie Izzard. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Harrogate Grand Opera House was designed by architect Frank Tugwell, whose other work includes the Futurist Theatre in Scarborough and the Savoy Theatre in London. &&&&& &&&&& The building opened on 13 January 1900 with a charity performance for soldiers fighting in the Boer War. This was followed by a run of Mr J. Tully's pantomime, Dick Whittington. &&&&& &&&&& The theatre still possesses many of its original front of house fixtures and fittings, as well as a modelled plaster freize by sculptor Frances Darlington in the foyer that depicts the development of arts through the ages. &&&&& &&&&& Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services &&&&& As was typical for a repertory theatre at the time, Harrogate Grand Opera house was home to an on-site workshop to build their sets. This was eventually set up as a commercial venture under the name of Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services (HTSS) and it is now a dedicated workshop located in Starbeck, Harrogate. HTSS constructs and delivers bespoke sets for venues and companies, both in the UK and internationally. It operates with an experienced team of woodworkers, metalworkers, scenic artists, painters and sculptors. &&&&& &&&&& Harrogate Youth Theatre &&&&& Harrogate Theatre runs a comprehensive program of activities to engage children and young people aged between 3 and 18 in theatre. It offers training in drama, singing and playwriting, with 10-week terms in the autumn, spring and summer. &&&&& &&&&& The Youth Theatre is currently based in HIVE, a dedicated space located next to the Harrogate Theatre building. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

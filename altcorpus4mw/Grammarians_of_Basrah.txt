558	Grammarians_of_Basrah
Grammarians of Basrah &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Grammarians of Basrah''' were grammarians and language scholars of Basra in the Islamic Golden Age, who laid down the rules of grammar and of literary style, and whose teachings and writings became the canon of the Arabic language. Shortly after the school's foundation in Basra, a rival school was established in Kufa, by the '''Grammarians of Kufa'''. The book ''Kitab al-Fihrist'' by the tenth century author, Ibn Ishaq al-Warraq, known as "al-Nadim", provides biographical details of the leading figures and is the principal source for early accounts of the two schools. The schools represent the two main branches in the development of Arabic grammar and punctuation, linguistics, philology, Quranic exegesis and recital, Hadith, poetry and literature. &&&&& &&&&& Founding & Most Celebrated Philologists &&&&& &&&&& *Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali Ẓālim ibn Amr ibn Sufyān (c. 605-688 CE) originator of Arabic grammar and founder of Baṣrah school.  &&&&& &&&&& *Abū 'Amr b. al-'Alā (689-770 CE), an eminent scholar and one of the seven readers of the Qur’ān, who burned his collections of old poetry, &c., to devote himself to religion. &&&&& *Khalīl ibn Aḥmad, (c. 718-786 CE) inventor of the Arabic system of metres who wrote the first Arabic lexicon (al-Kitābu ‘l-’Ayn); incomplete on his death. &&&&& *Sībawayh (d. 793/796 CE), the Persian whose Grammar, entitled 'The Book of Sībawayh,' is universally celebrated. &&&&& *al-Aṣma’ī (c. 739-833 CE) and Abū 'Ubayda(ca. 728-824), great humanists who flourished under Hārūn al-Rashid &&&&& *al-Mubarrad (d. 899 CE), philologist best-known for Al-Kāmil  &&&&& *al-Sukkarī (d. 889 CE), a collector and critic of old Arabian poetry and ancient tradition. &&&&& *Ibn Durayd (d. 934 CE), a distinguished philologist, genealogist, and poet, awarded a pension by caliph Al-Muqtadir for his contribution to science; principal works, his famous ode “The Maqṣūra,” a voluminous lexicon (al-'Jamhara fi ‘l-Lugha) and a treatise on the genealogies of the Arab tribes (Kitābu ‘l-Ishtiqāq). &&&&& *'Isa ibn 'Umar al-Thaqafi (d. 766/67 CE) blind, grammarian, Quran reciter, teacher of Sībawayh: - ''The Compilation''; ''The Perfected'' (Completed).

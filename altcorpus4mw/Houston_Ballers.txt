Houston Ballers &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Houston Ballers''' is a basketball team based in Houston, Texas. The team competes in the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), a league created for high school and junior college players as an alternative to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The JBA was first announced on December 20, 2017, when media personality LaVar Ball said to ''Slam'' magazine that he would create a professional league targeted at high school graduates and fully funded by his sports apparel company Big Baller Brand. The league held tryouts in Texas in April 2018, selecting a total of 14 players in Dallas and Houston for JBA rosters. One addition to the Houston Ballers roster was Jordon Myers, a former star guard and three-star recruit out of North Crowley High School in Fort Worth, Texas. However, their star player would be Curtis Hollis, a multi-athlete that played basketball and football, even originally receiving scholarships for North Texas University's football team before declining and electing to focus on basketball. &&&&& &&&&& Current roster &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * JBA official website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

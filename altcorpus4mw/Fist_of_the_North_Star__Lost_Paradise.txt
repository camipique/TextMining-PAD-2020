Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise''''' is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 4, based on the manga franchise ''Fist of the North Star'' by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara. It was released in Japan on March 8, 2018 and worldwide on October 2, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& ''Lost Paradise'' is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. It features experience points, abilities; and similar action-adventure gameplay mechanics and systems to Sega's own ''Yakuza'' series. Players explore the city of Eden, fighting through enemy encounters in a beat 'em up gameplay style, punctuated by quick time events. &&&&& &&&&& The action is centered on the "Hidden Channeling Points" system, one of the elements of Hokuto Shinken, the main martial arts style of the series. There are also various mini-games, such as bartending, baseball, racing, and retro games that can be played after being salvaged from the wastelands, such as ''Hokuto no Ken'' for the Sega Mark III, ''Space Harrier'', ''Out Run'' and ''Super Hang-On''. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& &&&&& The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic alternate timeline Earth. After a nuclear war, the oceans have dried up. Kenshiro, a successor of the martial art Hokuto Shinken, was defeated by Shin, who proceeded to kidnap his fianc√©e, Yuria. Kenshiro thus travels through the wastelands to find his beloved. He eventually hears rumors that a woman called Yuria could be found in the city of Eden - he makes his way to Eden to find Yuria. &&&&& &&&&& Development and marketing &&&&& TGS 2017 &&&&& &&&&& ''Lost Paradise'' was announced on August 26, 2017 for PlayStation 4. Studio head Toshihiro Nagoshi elaborated that the title would not make use of their new Dragon Engine, developed for ''Yakuza 6'', as the development team was composed of largely new staff, who were not used to the more demanding tools of the Dragon Engine. &&&&& &&&&& The Japanese voice cast features many of the actors from the ''Yakuza'' series portraying characters analogous to those they played in previous ''Yakuza'' titles, such as Kazuma Kiryu voice actor Takaya Kuroda playing Kenshiro. The worldwide release of the game includes an English dub, making it the studio's second game since the original ''Yakuza'' and ''Binary Domain'' to feature one. The worldwide release also includes an option to increase the amount of in-game gore that is exhibited on screen. It is also the first ''Fist of the North Star'' game since the first ''Ken's Rage'' to have an English dub, as ''Ken's Rage 2'' did not have one due to budget constraints. &&&&& &&&&& Sega launched a marketing campaign in Japan, starring actor Takayuki Yamada. In the ad campaign, the actor goes to the gym, performing famous moves and gestures from the manga series. During E3 2018, Sega announced the western release of ''Lost Paradise'' with a trailer and a large presence at Sega's booth. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In its first week of release in Japan, the game sold 123,116 copies, charting into first place, above Capcom's ''Monster Hunter: World''. &&&&& &&&&& The game won the award for "Writing in a Comedy" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, whereas its other nomination was for "Game, Franchise Action". &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

FlowCore Systems &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''FlowCore Systems, LLC''' is an American manufacturing company established in 2014. Headquartered in Williston, North Dakota, FlowCore produces an automated system of freshwater management and chemical injection intended to replace mechanical pumping systems. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& FlowCore was founded in 2014 by Chuck Black, automation engineer and published author. &&&&& &&&&& Black's ties to the manufacturing sector date back to the late 1970s, when his brother Wes Black invented a construction line reel used for marking concrete. Sold under the trademarked name Stringliner, the tool struggled to gain retail momentum, with sales tapering off by the early 1980s. Then, as Black's father and three brothers were working in mud engineering at the tail end of the 80s oil boom, they decided to revisit the product and revive Stringliner. With a background in electrical engineering, Black began developing automations to increase the company's production. &&&&& &&&&& After Stringliner was sold in 2014, an extended family member approached Black about an issue he was experiencing with chemical pumps in the oil and gas industry. Black recounted to DAWA Solutions Group, "He came to me and explained the number of problems he was having with chemical pumps in the field: ’I’m spending 60% of my time fixing malfunctioning pumps and blocked check valves, there’s got to be a better way,’ he told me." &&&&& &&&&& Setting out to design a system that was low-maintenance with increased chemical metering accuracy, Black developed the FC500 fresh water and chemical injection system. &&&&& &&&&& Products &&&&& FlowCore's flagship product is the FC500 fresh water management and chemical injection system, which launched commercially in July 2017. The system is built to self-dose using parameters set by the operator and chemical company, measure the results, and adjust accordingly to meet the desired target based on that day's water and chemical performance. &&&&& &&&&& Data from the FC500 is captured using an online application called FlowSite, which creates interactive reports and trend analysis charts. &&&&& &&&&& Recognition &&&&& * '''2016:''' Finalist for American Petroleum Institute's Industry Innovation award &&&&& * '''2017:''' Winner of American Petroleum Institute's Industry Innovation award &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

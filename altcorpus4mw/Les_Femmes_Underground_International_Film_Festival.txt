Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival''' is an annual women's film festival held in the United States which previews new films of multiple genres, including documentaries, from over 30 different countries. Founded in 2015, the traveling festival is held annually (usually in September) at various venues in the Southwestern United States. It is based in Los Angeles, CA. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival originated in September 2016 at Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in Venice, CA. It was founded the previous year, after filmmaker Edda Manriquez attended a Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media seminar at CalArts. In 2017, the festival was held at Digital Gym Cinema in San Diego, CA, and in 2018, it is set to be held at Phoenix Center for the Arts in Phoenix, AZ. Manriquez and her partner created the festival with the intent of bringing feminist diversity to media, breaking gender-based stereotypes, and empowering young female filmmakers to generate such work. They also sought to bridge cultural and socioeconomic restrictions and became a traveling film festival with the intent of alleviating traveling costs for emerging feminist filmmakers while giving them a platform and celebrating their accomplishments. The Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival is a registered non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. &&&&& &&&&& The festival specializes in fourth-wave feminist film sub-genres, including documentary, experimental, narrative, horror, animation, and VR. They focus on "subversive, unique, and innovative" topics such as female sexuality, esotericism, witchcraft, and occult ideology in support of gender equality, women's independence, and women's empowerment. Manriquez is cited as calling the festival "a cinematic adventure that destroys the meaning of mundane through its unique programming via the underground world of feminist intersectional art, music, and celluloid fantasies." &&&&& &&&&& The festival also provides outreach events, including Books for Babes, a literacy initiative which aims to bring feminist children's books to underrepresented communities, including teenage mothers, women's shelters, low-income areas, and single parent households, in the United States. They also provide traveling workshops in health and wellness, women's empowerment, career resources, and financial assistance to women and female-identifying artists who are attempting to acquire film distribution and further their careers. They focus specifically on the Boyle Heights and San Fernando Valley areas in Los Angeles, CA. &&&&& &&&&& The Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival hosts regular panels and events, including a screening of the documentary ''Fattitude'' at Echo Park Film Center, which explored the topic "Deconstructing the Female Body in Media" during Women's History Month in 2018. Panel alumni guests for the ''Fattitude'' screening and panel include writer and actress Celia Finkelstein, author and sociology professor Abigail C. Saguy, activist and public speaker Pia Schiavo-Campo, and author and speaker Ragen Chastain. &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& Jury awards are given for Experimental Film, Narrative Film, Documentary Film, and Animated Film. &&&&& &&&&& Past winners &&&&& &&&&& === 2016 Jury Awards === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Film &&&&& &&&&& Director &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jury Award''' &&&&& &&&&& ''Hoop Dreams'' &&&&& &&&&& Sam Gurry &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''First of the Free Girls'' &&&&& &&&&& Alexandra Velasco & Alexander Kahan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''VAL-EN-TINA'' &&&&& &&&&& Araeia Robinson &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''The River'' &&&&& &&&&& Ya-Ting Hsu & Geoffrey Hughes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Rougarou'' &&&&& &&&&& Catherine Taylor &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& === 2017 Jury Awards === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Film &&&&& &&&&& Director &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jury Award''' &&&&& &&&&& ''Troll: A Southern Tale'' &&&&& &&&&& Marinah Janello &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Tomato'' &&&&& &&&&& Caitlin Craggs &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Quetzal'' &&&&& &&&&& Irene Marco &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Sacrifice'' &&&&& &&&&& Elena Passani & Jade Touron &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Sherry'' &&&&& &&&&& Eliane Lima &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Brew Master'' &&&&& &&&&& Kelly Jean Karam &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Naked in the Dog Park'' &&&&& &&&&& Tiffany Rhodes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Intelligent toilet &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& An '''intelligent toilet''' (sometimes referred to as a modern day bidet) is a bathroom plumbing fixture or type of electronic bidet toilet which incorporates traditional bidet cleansing (for genital, buttocks and anus hygiene), with the added enhancement of modern SMART home technology. Modern intelligent toilets incorporate electronic bidet cleansing functions into a ceramic toilet bowl for a low-profile and modern aesthetic. Intelligent toilet bidet functions are managed through voice command, mobile app or remote control navigation, depending on the toilet’s manufacturer, make and model.  &&&&& &&&&& Lower-cost options include a detachable toilet seat referred to as an "electronic bidet(“e-bidet”)" seat, which are becoming increasingly popular as well. &&&&& &&&&& Features &&&&& * Electronic bidet shower for front (lady) and rear cleansing  &&&&& * Seat-warming &&&&& * Adjustable water temperature &&&&& * Deodorizer  &&&&& * Air dryer &&&&& * Many models offer water-conservative 1.0-1.28GPF  &&&&& * Illuminating nightlight &&&&& &&&&& == Health applications == &&&&& Intelligent toilets and electronic bidets aid numerous health concerns, especially for users with sensitive or damaged skin.

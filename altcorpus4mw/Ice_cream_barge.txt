Ice cream barge &&&&& Introduction &&&&& An '''ice cream barge''' was a vessel employed by the United States Navy in the Pacific Theatre of World War II to produce ice cream in large quantities to be provisioned to sailors and Marines. The craft, a concrete barge acquired from the U.S. Army and worth $1 million, was said to be able to create 10 gallons of ice cream every seven minutes, or approximately 500 gallons per shift. It was employed in the USN's Western Pacfic area of operations, at one point anchored at Ulithi. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *USS ''Quartz'' (IX-150), a contemporary of the ice cream barge, used as a "crockery" ship &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& ===Sources=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Gregory Hannon &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Gregory James Hannon''' is a professor of molecular cancer biology and director of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute at the University of Cambridge. He is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge while also serving as a director of cancer genomics at the New York Genome Center and an adjunct professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. &&&&& &&&&& Hannon is known for his contributions to small RNA biology, cancer biology, and mammalian genomics. He has a history in discovery of oncogenes, beginning with work that led to the identification of CDK inhibitors and their links to cancer. More recently, his work has focused on small RNA biology, which led to an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms and biological functions of RNA interference (RNAi). He has developed widely used tools and strategies for manipulation of gene expression in mammalian cells and animals and has generated genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries that are available to the cancer community and was among the first to demonstrate roles for microRNAs in cancer. His laboratory also discovered the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway and linked this to transposon repression and the protection of germ cell genomes. His innovations include the development of selective re-sequencing strategies, broadly termed exome capture. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

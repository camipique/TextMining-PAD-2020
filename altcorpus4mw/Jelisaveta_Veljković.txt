Jelisaveta Veljković &&&&& Introduction &&&&& ''' Jelisaveta Veljković''' (; born 1951) is a politician in Serbia. She is currently serving her second term in the National Assembly of Serbia as a member of the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS). &&&&& &&&&& Private career &&&&& Veljković is a retired teacher living in Sremski Karlovci, Vojvodina. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& The PUPS contested the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election on an electoral list led by the Socialist Party of Serbia. Veljković received the thirty-ninth position on the list and was elected when the list won forty-four mandates. The PUPS was not part of Serbia's government during the parliament that followed, but the party provided external support to the government in the assembly. &&&&& &&&&& For the 2016 parliamentary election, the PUPS formed a new alliance with the Serbian Progressive Party, and Veljković received the 231st position on the Progressive-led ''Aleksandar Vučić – Serbia Is Winning'' list.. This was too low a position for direct election to be a realistic prospect, and indeed she was not initially elected, even though the list won a majority victory with 131 out of 250 mandates. She did, however, receive a new mandate on 21 April 2017 as a replacement for PUPS deputy Konstantin Arsenović, who had died in January of that year. The PUPS currently serves in Serbia's coalition government, and Veljković again serves as a government supporter in the assembly. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

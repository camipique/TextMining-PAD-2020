Gears 5 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Gears 5''''' is an upcoming third-person shooter video game being developed by The Coalition that will be published by Xbox Game Studios for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One as part of Xbox Play Anywhere. The sixth installment of the ''Gears of War'' series, it is the sequel to ''Gears of War 4'' and is scheduled to be released sometime in 2019. &&&&& &&&&& Premise &&&&& ''Gears 5'' focuses on Kait Diaz (Laura Bailey), an Outsider of Locust descent. As Kait, the player must uncover the origins of the Locust and Kait's family. ''Gears of War 4'' protagonist JD Fenix (Liam McIntyre), his friend Delmont Walker (Eugene Byrd), and JD's father Marcus Fenix (John DiMaggio) also return. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& In addition to single-player gameplay, the game will support local split screen or online cooperative gameplay. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& ''Gears 5'' is being developed by The Coalition as a sequel to ''Gears of War 4''. Unlike previous games in the ''Gears of War'' series, the game is simply titled ''Gears 5'' (without the "of War" part). Xbox marketing boss Aaron Greenberg explained that the new title was "cleaner" and that it was a natural change because most people had been cutting out the "of War" part for years. For ''Gears 5'', The Coalition decided to shift player focus from JD Fenix to Kait Diaz. According to studio head Rod Fergusson, "It was a natural choice. When you play through ''Gears 4'', think of it as ''Mad Max: Fury Road''. It was really Furiosa's story, and Max was the side kick. That's how it felt in ''Gears 4'', the whole game is about saving Kait's mom, and really JD is there to help her." &&&&& &&&&& Marketing and release &&&&& ''Gears 5'' was announced at E3 2018, along with ''Gears POP!'' and ''Gears Tactics''. The game is scheduled to be released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2019 as part of Xbox Play Anywhere. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

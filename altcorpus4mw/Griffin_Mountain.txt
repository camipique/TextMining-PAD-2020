Griffin Mountain &&&&& Introduction &&&&& right &&&&& &&&&& '''''Griffin Mountain''''' is a 1981 role-playing game supplement for ''RuneQuest'' published by Chaosium. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Griffin Mountain'' is a complete fantasy campaign, set in the primitive land of Balazar. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& David Dunham reviewed ''Griffin Mountain'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 48. Dunham commented that "''Griffin Mountain'' represents the state of the art in published scenarios. It's more than a soulless listing of characteristics or a collection of disjointed encounters. I highly recommend it to all ''RuneQuest'' referees, and to anyone who wants an example of how a campaign should be set up." &&&&& &&&&& Reviews &&&&& *''White Dwarf'' #27 (Oct./Nov., 1981) &&&&& *''Dragon'' #58 (Feb., 1982) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

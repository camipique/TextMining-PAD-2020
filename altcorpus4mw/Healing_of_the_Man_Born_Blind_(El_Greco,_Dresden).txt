Healing of the Man Born Blind (El Greco, Dresden) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Healing of the Man Born Blind''''' is a painting of the healing of the man born blind by El Greco, produced in 1567 during his time in Venice. It is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. &&&&& &&&&& It marks his first use of a space marked by perspective, abandoning the perspective-less Byzantine style in which he had been trained. It shows the heavy influence of Tintoretto, Titian and Veronese. He returned to the subject five years later, in a work now in Parma. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * ÁLVAREZ LOPERA, José, ''El Greco'', Madrid, Arlanza, 2005, Biblioteca «Descubrir el Arte», (colección «Grandes maestros»). . &&&&& * SCHOLZ-HÄNSEL, Michael, ''El Greco'', Colonia, Taschen, 2003. . &&&&& * https://web.archive.org/web/20101129094512/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/6301.htm &&&&& &&&&&

260	Fox-1D
Fox-1D &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Fox-1D''', '''AO-92''' or '''AMSAT OSCAR 92''' is an American amateur radio satellite. Fox-1D is a 1U CubeSat developed and built by AMSAT-NA. Fox-1D carries a single-channel transponder for mode U/V in FM. Fox-1D has an L-band converter (the AMSAT L-band downshifter experiment), which allows the FM transponder to be switched on an uplink in the band. &&&&& &&&&& To enable it to launch under NASA's '''ELaNa''' ('''Educational Launch of Nanosatellites''') program, the satellite continues to carry the following scientific and technical payloads: &&&&& &&&&& * High Energy Radiation CubeSat (HERCI); &&&&& * Camera Experiment; &&&&& * MEMS GYRO Experiment. &&&&& &&&&& The satellite has a single whip antenna for the 70cm and 23cm bands (uplink), as well as an antenna for the 2m band (downlink). &&&&& &&&&& Mission &&&&& The satellite was launched on January 12, 2018 at 03:59 UTC with a PSLV XL rocket, along with the main payloads Cartosat-2F, NovaSAR-S, and 31 other small satellites from the Satish Dhawan Space Center, India. At 05:17 UTC, the antennas were deployed over the North Pole and the satellite began to work. At 05:28 UTC the first telemetry was received. Commissioning is scheduled for approximately two weeks. After that Fox-1D should be available for connections between amateur radio stations. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Frequencies &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 145.880 MHz downlink &&&&& &&&&& FM, data transmission DUV 200 bps and FSK 9600 bps, 400 - 800 mW &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 435.350 MHz uplink &&&&& &&&&& FM CTCSS 67.0 Hz &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1,267,350 MHz uplink &&&&& &&&&& FM CTCSS 67.0 Hz &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * OSCAR &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Project OSCAR &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

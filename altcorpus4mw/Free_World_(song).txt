Free World (song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Free World'''" is a song by British singer and songwriter Kirsty MacColl, released in 1989 as the lead single from her second studio album ''Kite''. It was written by MacColl and produced by Steve Lillywhite. "Free World" reached No. 43 in the UK and remained in the charts for seven weeks. A music video was filmed to promote the single. &&&&& &&&&& Speaking to the ''Evening Times'' in 1989, MacColl said of the song: "It's really about greed. But it's all part of the great divide between North and South. This Government has probably done more than any other to worsen it." She added in an interview with ''New Musical Express'': ""Free World" is very direct and simple; hopefully it'll make people think a bit. The subject matter is Thatcherite Britain – you know, grab whatever you can and sod the little guy. That's a fashionable way of looking at things, and I don't agree with it." &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& In a review of ''Kite'', Steve Hochman of ''Rolling Stone'' felt the song "slams home a warning of women's frustration in the world with U2-like frenzy". ''CD Review'' considered the song to be "U2-influenced". Stewart Mason of AllMusic described the song as one of MacColl's "most combative songs". In the 2003 book ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', authors Peter and Jonathan Buckley said of the song: ""Free World" is an unusually melodic example of an anti-Thatcherite diatribe. It's not the MacColl that casual visitors to the charts would recognize, but then that was her all over." ''The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock'' described the song as having a "full-bodied pop style". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& ;7" single &&&&& #"Free World" - 2:35 &&&&& #"Closer to God?" - 3:55 &&&&& &&&&& ;10" single (UK limited edition release) &&&&& #"Free World" - 2:35 &&&&& #"Closer to God?" - 3:55 &&&&& #"The End of a Perfect Day (Original Demo Version)" - 3:13 &&&&& &&&&& ;12" single &&&&& #"Free World" - 2:35 &&&&& #"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby" - 2:44 &&&&& #"Closer to God?" - 3:55 &&&&& &&&&& ;CD single &&&&& #"Free World" - 2:35 &&&&& #"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby" - 2:44 &&&&& #"Closer to God?" - 3:55 &&&&& #"La Forêt De Mimosas" - 3:37 &&&&& &&&&& ;CD single (UK promo) &&&&& #"Free World" - 2:35 &&&&& &&&&& Chart performance &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (1989) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Australian Singles Chart &&&&& &&&&& 162 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& UK Singles Chart &&&&& &&&&& 43 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& * Kirsty MacColl - vocals &&&&& * Pete Glenister - acoustic guitar, electric guitar &&&&& * James Eller - double bass &&&&& * David Palmer - drums &&&&& * Paul Crowder - tambourine &&&&& &&&&& ;Production &&&&& * Steve Lillywhite - producer &&&&& * Alan Douglas - engineer &&&&& * Mark Wallis - mixing &&&&& &&&&& ;Other &&&&& * Bill Smith Studio, Kirsty MacColl - sleeve design &&&&& * Charles Dickins - photography &&&&& * XL Talent - management &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Henry Darnall II &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Henry Darnall II''' (1682-1759) was a wealthy Roman Catholic planter in Colonial Maryland. He was the son of the politician and planter Henry Darnall, who was the Proprietary Agent of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, and served for a time as Deputy Governor of the Province. During the Protestant Revolution of 1689, Henry Darnall I's proprietarial army was defeated by the Puritan army of Colonel John Coode, and he was stripped of his numerous colonial offices. After his father's death, Henry Darnall II did not enjoy political power in Maryland, but he remained wealthy thanks to his family's extensive estates. He married twice, fathering many children. His eldest son Henry Darnall III (c1702-c1783) inherited the bulk of what remained of his estates, and one of his grandchildren, Daniel Carroll, would become one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Henry Darnall's father, Henry Darnall I &&&&& Henry Darnall II was born in 1682 in Maryland, the son of the wealthy Roman Catholic planter and politician Henry Darnall (1645 – 17 June 1711) and his wife Eleanor Hatton Brooke (1642–1725).

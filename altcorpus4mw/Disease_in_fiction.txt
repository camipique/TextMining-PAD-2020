Disease in fiction &&&&& Introduction &&&&& 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke for Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 ''The Masque of the Red Death'' &&&&& Diseases, both real and fictional, play a significant role in fiction, with certain diseases like Huntington's disease and tuberculosis appearing in many books and films. Pandemic plagues threatening all human life, such as ''The Andromeda Strain'', are among the many fictional diseases described in literature and film. &&&&& &&&&& Real diseases &&&&& &&&&& Victor Hugo's character Fantine (in his 1862 novel ''Les Miserables'') with consumption in an 1886 painting by Margaret Bernadine Hall &&&&& &&&&& Genuine plagues have formed the central elements of books from Giovanni Boccaccio's c. 1353 ''The Decameron'' onwards. Bocaccio tells the tales of ten people of Florence who escape from the Black Death in their city. The book inspired Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century ''Canterbury Tales'', which similarly tells the stories of people on pilgrimage in a time of plague. Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film ''The Seventh Seal'' () is set in Denmark during the Black Death, and features a game of chess with Death personified as a monk-like figure. &&&&& &&&&& Tuberculosis was a common disease in the 19th century, and it appeared in several major works of Russian literature. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in ''Crime and Punishment''; Kirillov in ''The Possessed'', and both Ippolit and Marie in ''The Idiot.'' Turgenev did the same with Bazarov in ''Father and Sons''. In English literature of the Victorian era, major tuberculosis novels include Charles Dickens's 1848 ''Dombey and Son'', Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 ''North and South'', and Mrs. Humphry Ward's 1900 ''Eleanor''. &&&&& &&&&& Albert Camus's 1947 ''The Plague'', probably based on cholera in 19th century France, was seen both as fable about the need for people to help each other in the meaningless world seen by existentialism, and as alluding to the German invasion of France, fresh in Camus's mind. &&&&& &&&&& Huntington's disease appears in many novels, such as Ian McEwan's 2005 ''Saturday''. It was criticised as prejudiced in the medical journal ''The Lancet'' for its negative portrayal of the protagonist with the disease. &&&&& &&&&& Fictional diseases &&&&& &&&&& Jack London's 1912 ''The Scarlet Plague'' was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of ''Famous Fantastic Mysteries'' &&&&& &&&&& Diseases, especially if infectious, have long been popular themes and plot devices in fiction. Daniel Defoe's pioneering 1722 ''A Journal of the Plague Year'' is a fictional diary of a man's life during the plague year of 1665 in England. Mary Shelley's 1826 ''The Last Man'' created the genre of "post-apocalyptic pandemic thriller" with her story of a plague that is spreading across Europe towards her protagonists in Britain. Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 "The Masque of the Red Death" is a gothic tale of a plague, perhaps symbolising the hubris of the wealthy, and their nemesis. More recently, Michael Crichton's 1969 ''The Andromeda Strain'' is a science fiction thriller about a world-threatening microbe that a military satellite brings down to Earth and wipes out a town in Arizona. White-coated scientists do their best to contain the outbreak. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * Medical fiction &&&&& * Cestoda#In culture &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * Tirard, Nestor (1886) ''Disease in Fiction.

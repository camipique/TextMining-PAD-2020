EO Media Group &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''EO Media Group''' is a newspaper publishing company based in the U.S. state of Oregon. It publishes 10 newspapers in the state, and one in southwestern Washington. &&&&& &&&&& The company, which has been family-owned for four generations, was previously known as the East Oregonian Publishing Company. It is owned by the Forrester family, members of which previously owned several newspapers (including the ''East Oregonian'' and ''Daily Astorian'') independently. The connection between the ''East Oregonian'' and the ''Daily Astorian'' dates to 1909, when several ''East Oregonian'' staffers bought the ''Astoria Budget'', which was later merged with the ''Astorian''. In 1973, the father and son (J. W. Forrester and J. W. Forrester Jr.) who had been publishing the ''East Oregonian'' and the ''Daily Astorian'' switched positions. &&&&& &&&&& In addition to the ''East Oregonian'' and the ''Daily Astorian'', the group publishes the ''Blue Mountain Eagle'', ''The Hermiston Herald'', and the ''Wallowa County Chieftain'' in Eastern Oregon. The company also owns the ''Capital Press'' (an agricultural paper in Salem, Oregon), the ''Chinook Observer'' (Long Beach, Washington), and several other publications on the northern Oregon Coast: the ''Seaside Signal'', ''the Cannon Beach Gazette,'' ''Oregon Coast Today'' (Lincoln City, Oregon), and the '' Coast River Business Journal''. &&&&& &&&&& The group won a top regional award for its "Fate of Our Forests" series from the Society of Professional Journalists in 2012, in a regional group including papers under 25,000 circulation from Montana to Alaska. The same series, which ran in 2011, had previously won the Dolly Connelly Award for Excellence in Environmental Reporting from the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Association. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014, the EO Media Group partnered with the Pamplin Media Group, which publishes the ''Portland Tribune'' and 24 other weekly and monthly publications in Oregon, to form the Oregon Capital Bureau and publish the ''Oregon Capital Insider'' newsletter. The partnership came as the number of reporters assigned to state capital bureaus nationwide was on the decline. In 2018, the newly-launched ''Salem Reporter'' joined the bureau, and its publisher, Les Zaitz, was assigned to lead its three reporters. &&&&& &&&&& The Aldrich-Forrester-Bedford-Brown family, which owns the EO Media Group, was covered in the 2018 book ''Grit and Ink: An Oregon Family's Adventures in Newspapering, 1908â€“2018'' by William F. Willingham. The book was published by the EO Media Group; but according to the author, it isn't an "authorized biography," and he had "wide open" ground rules. The book will be distributed by the Oregon State University Press. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official web site &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

109	Irenodendron
Irenodendron &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Irenodendron''''' is a genus of three species of shrubs and trees in the willow family Salicaceae native to northern South America. These species were previously treated as a section of the genus ''Laetia'' in the family Flacourtiaceae, but the genus ''Laetia'' and its relatives were moved to the Salicaceae based on analyses of DNA data. ''Irenodendron'' was later hypothesized to be more closely related to the genera ''Ryania'', ''Trichostephanus'', and ''Piparea'' due to the presence of an apically divided style, and wood with dark heartwood and large rays; it differs from those genera in having cup-shaped bracts under the flowers and in lacking staminodes. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

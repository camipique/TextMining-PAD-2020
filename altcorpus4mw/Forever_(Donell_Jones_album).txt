Forever (Donell Jones album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Forever''''' is the seventh studio album by R&B singer Donell Jones. It was released on July 9, 2013 through eOne Music. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Allmusic editor Andy Kellman rated the album three ouf of five stars. He found that "more should be made of Jones' versatility. ''Forever'' is even closer to being a one-man show than 2010's ''Lyrics'', with Jones performing every instrument but guitar, and he gets only a little songwriting assistance (and no guest appearances from MCs)." Kellmann noted that while "apart from the surprisingly brash "Step the F*** Off" and the Michael Jackson tribute "I Miss the King," not much sticks out, but the album is consistently likeable, filled with comfortable, mid-wattage grooves, yearning ballads (including the Teena Marie-sampling "Closer I Get to You"), and a couple diversions into racier content &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2013) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * ''Forever'' at Allmusic &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

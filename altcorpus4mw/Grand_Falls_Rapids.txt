After a rough first three years in Woodstock, the Slammers eventually won three MHL championships, a Fred Page Cup, and were the runners-up in the 2006 Fred Page Cup. In 2018, after multiple losing seasons, the Woodstock Slammers organization applied for a one year leave of absence. Later in 2018, it was announced that the franchise would relocate to Grand Falls, New Brunswick, under a new ownership group. On June 6, 2018, their new name, the Grand Falls Rapids, was revealed. &&&&& &&&&& Season by Season record &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Season &&&&& &&&&& GP &&&&& &&&&& W &&&&& &&&&& L &&&&& &&&&& OTL &&&&& &&&&& SL &&&&& &&&&& GF &&&&& &&&&& GA &&&&& &&&&& Pts &&&&& &&&&& Results &&&&& &&&&& Playoffs &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018â€“19	 &&&&& &&&&& 50	 &&&&& &&&&& 13	 &&&&& &&&&& 30	 &&&&& &&&&& 5	 &&&&& &&&&& 2	 &&&&& &&&&& 153	 &&&&& &&&&& 239	 &&&&& &&&&& 33	 &&&&& &&&&& 11th MHL	 &&&&& &&&&& Did not qualify &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of ice hockey teams in New Brunswick &&&&& *Canadian Junior Hockey League &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Maritime Junior Hockey League website &&&&& * Canadian Junior Hockey League website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

John Preston (author, born 1953) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''John Preston''' (born 1953) is an English journalist and novelist. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& John Preston worked as the Arts Editor of ''The Evening Standard'' and ''The Sunday Telegraph''. He was ''The Sunday Telegraph's'' television critic for ten years and one of its chief feature writers. &&&&& &&&&& Preston wrote four novels between 1996 and 2007. All are set in the recent past: ''Ghosting'' in the world of radio and television in the 1950s; ''Ink'' in the dying days of Fleet Street's importance in journalism in the 1980s; ''Kings of the Roundhouse'' in strife-torn London in the 1970s; and ''The Dig'' in the 1930s. Preston wrote ''The Dig'', a novelised account of the Sutton Hoo archaeological dig, after discovering that his aunt had been one of the key participants. ''A Very English Scandal'', Preston's non-fiction account of the Jeremy Thorpe affair of the 1970s, was adapted into a television miniseries in 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Critical assessments &&&&& ''The Sunday Times'' reviewer of ''Ink'' said, "With a rare gift for both humour and desolation, Preston is a brilliant new player in the field of serious comedy." Reviewing ''Kings of the Roundhouse'' in ''The Guardian'', Harry Ritchie called it "that unusual thing â€“ an intelligent comic novel that really is very funny". The Labour politician Chris Mullin said ''A Very English Scandal'' was "probably the most forensic, elegantly written and compelling account of one of the 20th century's great political scandals ... a real page-turner" and an "entertaining mix of tragedy and farce". &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& * ''Touching the Moon'' (1991; non-fiction, about a trip to the Mountains of the Moon in Uganda) &&&&& * ''Ghosting'' (1996; novel) &&&&& * ''Ink'' (1999; novel) &&&&& * ''Kings of the Roundhouse'' (2006; novel) &&&&& * ''The Dig'' (2007; novel) &&&&& * ''A Very English Scandal: Sex, Lies and a Murder Plot at the Heart of the Establishment'' (2016; non-fiction, on the Jeremy Thorpe affair) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

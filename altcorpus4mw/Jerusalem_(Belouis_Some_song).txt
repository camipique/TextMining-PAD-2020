Jerusalem (Belouis Some song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Jerusalem'''" is a song by British singer and songwriter Belouis Some, released in 1986 as the fourth and final single from his debut studio album ''Some People''. It was written by Belouis Some, and produced by Pete Schwier, Steve Thompson, Michael Barbiero and Belouis Some. "Jerusalem" reached No. 98 in the UK and remained in the charts for one week. &&&&& &&&&& In a 1984 interview with ''Debut'', Belouis Some described the song's lyrics as "really heavy". He stated: ""Jerusalem" is a bit depressing, it's just me trying to be clever, but I'm not trying to get any message across." For its release as a single, the song was remixed by Thompson and Barbiero in May 1986. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Upon release, Lola Borg of ''Smash Hits'' wrote: "It's smooth 'n' moody, a tinge on the pretentious side and sounds as though he's recruited David Bowie on vocals and Sooty on xylophone. And as for the lyrics - what on earth is he going on about?" Dave Ling of ''Number One'' stated: ""Jerusalem" sees a drop in pace after his last couple of re-releases. Unfortunately this strategy blows up in his face as this rather laboured song just forces home how average a vocalist our Nev really is." Roger Morton of ''Record Mirror'' commented: "Mr Some has tried for a big pop song here. One of those epic musclebound ballads, awash with splendid synthesised atmospherics. As an idea, it's wonderful. As a record, it plods." &&&&& &&&&& In a review of ''Some People'', ''Voice of Youth Advocates'' said: "...on tracks such as the elaborate "Jerusalem," he seems to reveal his true affinity, a highly textured art rock". Lisa Clark of ''Smash Hits'' described the song as "haunting" and "David Bowie-inspired". David Marx of ''Debut'' described the song as "haunting" and "inevitable but fascinating". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& ;7" single &&&&& #"Jerusalem" - 5:47 &&&&& #"Target Practice" - 4:36 &&&&& &&&&& ;2x 7" single (double-pack release) &&&&& #"Jerusalem" - 5:47 &&&&& #"Target Practice" - 4:36 &&&&& #"Round and Round" - 4:09 &&&&& #"Stand Down" - 3:11 &&&&& &&&&& ;12" single &&&&& #"Jerusalem (Long Version)" - 5:39 &&&&& #"Jerusalem (Instrumental Version)" - 5:54 &&&&& #"Target Practice (Dance Mix)" - 6:01 &&&&& &&&&& Chart performance &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (1986) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& UK Singles Chart &&&&& &&&&& 98 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& *Belouis Some - vocals, producer of "Jerusalem" and "Round and Round" &&&&& *Pete Schwier - producer of "Jerusalem" and "Stand Down" &&&&& *Steve Thompson, Michael Barbiero - producers of "Jerusalem" and "Target Practice", remixing on "Jerusalem" and "Stand Down" &&&&& *Jason Carsaro - remixing on "Target Practice" &&&&& *Bernard Edwards, Walter Samuel - producers of "Round and Round" &&&&& *Ian Little - producer of "Stand Down" &&&&& &&&&& ;Other &&&&& *Accident - sleeve design &&&&& *Eric Watson - photography &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

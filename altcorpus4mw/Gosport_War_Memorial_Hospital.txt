Gosport War Memorial Hospital &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Gosport War Memorial Hospital''' is a hospital in Gosport, Hampshire, England, part of the Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The foundation stone for the hospital, which was built as a memorial to members of the Portsmouth Division of the Royal Marine Light Infantry based at Forton Barracks who had died in the First World War, was laid by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 3 July 1921. The hospital opened on 19 April 1923. The East Wing was added in 1932 and the Canon Landon memorial clock, which recognised the life of Canon Guy Landon, Rector of Alverstoke from 1907 to 1947, was added following his death. &&&&& &&&&& The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. New out-patient and accident and emergency departments were added in 1963 and a physical medicine and x-ray facility was added in 1966. A petition with 20,000 signatures prevented the hospital from closing in the early 1980s. A new maternity ward opened in the early 1990s. &&&&& &&&&& Opioid deaths &&&&& On 20 June 2018 the '''Gosport Independent Panel''', led by Bishop James Jones, after an enquiry which took four years and cost Â£14 million, published a report which found that 456 deaths in the 1990s had "followed inappropriate administration of opioid drugs". In his introduction the bishop says: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& If the similar cases with missing records are taken into account, the true number of victims may be up to 650. &&&&& &&&&& The panel found that the hospital management, local healthcare organisations, Hampshire Constabulary, the Crown Prosecution Service, the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, and local politicians had all failed to act to protect patients and their families. &&&&& &&&&& The deaths were investigated for an episode of ''Panorama'' shown on 21 January 2019. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * ''Full text of the report and link to downloadable pdf file'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

House of F. N. Solodov &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''House of FN Solodov''' () is an place of cultural heritage and regional value in Rostov-on-Don. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The house was built in the 19th century. In the 1880's it was expanded with the addition of a two-story wing, according to plans developed by architect Nikolay Aleksandrovich Doroshenko. The owner of the house ran a factory of malts, which primarily produced flour. The structure adjoined a factory complex (Solodova). At the beginning of the 20th century, in documents, it appeared as the property of Nicolay's wife Ekaterina Nikolaevna Solodova. "The House of Workers of Education", also known as the "Teacher's Club," was located inside the building. A large library was also used by the schoolâ€™s teachers and students. &&&&& &&&&& The house adopted an eclectic design. Window openings were squared, as well as sub-window niches and sockets. The two-story house had a rectangular plan and a cellar in the center. The house was also plastered. Semi-circular window openings were issued by simple plat bands and parapets were encased in openwork metal protection. The modeled decor was presented by macarons that decorated capstones and arms; they met in a registration of attics. While carrying out repair work, an overlapping roof was made. Lattices on the first-floor windows, as well as the initial filling of window and door openings, were lost. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

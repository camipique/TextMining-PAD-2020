Hexavalent vaccine &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& A hexavalent vaccine, or 6-in-1 vaccine, is a combination vaccine with six individual vaccines conjugated into one, intended to protect people from multiple diseases. The principal example is a pediatric vaccine, used in more than 90 countries around the world including in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus B, and hepatitis B. &&&&& &&&&& Formulations &&&&& The generic vaccine is known as diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (recombinant) and haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine. The liquid vaccine is also known in abbreviated form as DTaP-HepB-IPV-Hib or DTPa-HepB-IPV-Hib. Branded formulations have included Hexavac, Hexaxim, Hexyon, and Vaxelis manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, and EasySix manufactured by Panacea Biotec. &&&&& &&&&& There is a two-part formulation known in abbreviated form as DTaP-IPV-HepB/Hib or DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib. It consists of a suspension of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, and inactivated poliomyelitis (DTaP-IPV-HepB or DTPa-HBV-IPV) vaccine that is used to reconstitute a lyophilised (freeze-dried) Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) powder.

John T. Cockerell &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''John T. Cockerell''' was a collector of specimens for zo√∂logists, active in Australia sometime between 1865 and 1891. &&&&& &&&&& In reviewing an outlying record of ''Purpureicephalus spurius'' (red-capped parrot) at Port Essington, repeated by John Gould and other ornithologists, ''Birds of Australia'' gave this caution on Cockerell's specimens. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The ''Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive'' 'Key to Scientific Names' notes possible biographical details as "(?1828-1907) Australian (?)", a middle name of Thomas, and places him in Hong Kong 1847 in a government position, commissariat storekeeper, also a soldier of fortune, seafarer and naturalist, who settled in Queensland about 1860. &&&&& &&&&& His son, James F. Cockerell (?1844-1897), followed in his father's occupation. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

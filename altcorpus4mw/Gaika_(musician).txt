Gaika (musician) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Gaika Tavares''', better known simply as '''GAIKA''', is a British artist and writer from South London. His debut album, ''Basic Volume'', was released in July 2018 by Warp Records, who describe the sound as "gothic dancehall and industrial electronics". &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Gaika's parents came from Grenada and Jamaica, and he grew up in Brixton, South London. He was previously a part of Manchester rap crew Murkage. &&&&& &&&&& Music career &&&&& Following the mixtapes ''Machine'' and ''Security'', Gaika released the EP ''Spaghetto'' in 2016. The Guardian described his music as blending "Caribbean dancehall tradition and London grime but also nod to R&B, trip-hop, grunge and Prince." ''Dazed'' have described him as "electronic music's answer to Basquiat", while US magazine ''Interview'' described the sound as "experimental R&B". GAIKA himself has described his sound using the word "Ghettofuturism". &&&&& &&&&& GAIKA's debut album ''Basic Volume'' was released in July 2018. ''The Guardian'' praised the album as "a terrifically impressive and populist debut". The album also received positive reviews from the ''Financial Times'',''The Independent'', ''Noisey'' and ''Music OMH''. &&&&& &&&&& In August 2018, Gaika exhibited ''SYSTEM'', a collaboration with Boiler Room and Somerset House Studios, "a sculpture which fills the middle portion of the Lancaster Room at Somerset House." He told the ''Evening Standard'' that "Carnival and sound system culture is about space, and holding space. It’s about literally drawing a line in the sand and saying: ‘This is who we are and we’re here to stay. You can’t turn us off’." &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Writing for ''Dazed'' magazine in June 2018, GAIKA criticised the Metropolitan Police's decision to crack down on Drill music, saying: "Drill is the product of a looted world that wasn’t designed with us in mind, the result of much more than just a few angry kids on estates, it’s the result of centuries of reality." GAIKA has also discussed the ways in which the Notting Hill Carnival is presented by the press, while its cultural significance is overlooked. &&&&& &&&&& Gaika has also written fiction for ''Dazed''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

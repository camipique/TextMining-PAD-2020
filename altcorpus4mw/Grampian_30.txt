The crew remained on board while the boat was laid on its side for four hours as they had no escape in the storm. After the storm had abated and the tide went out, the boat was left high and dry. When the tide came back in the boat was floated off the shore. Back in port the only damage found was bent keel bolts. &&&&& &&&&& In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, "Regardless of the their size category, the various Grampian models have one thing in common - they offer a lot of boat for relatively little money... Some people find that it isn't the sleekest looking sailboat, and that its appearance may be a little dated, but the Grampian 30 is very much a modern 30 foot production fiberglass sailboat of the 1970s. While it has been suggested that this model doesn't quite live up to the Grampian 26's reputation as a good sailing boat, it does have a nice interior layout with loads of room." &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *List of sailing boat types &&&&& &&&&& '''Similar sailboats''' &&&&& *Alberg 30 &&&&& *Alberg Odyssey 30 &&&&& *Aloha 30 &&&&& *Annie 30 &&&&& *Bahama 30 &&&&& *C&C 1/2 Ton &&&&& *C&C 30 &&&&& *C&C 30 Redwing &&&&& *Catalina 30 &&&&& *Catalina 309 &&&&& *CS 30 &&&&& *Hunter 30 &&&&& *Hunter 30T &&&&& *Hunter 30-2 &&&&& *Hunter 306 &&&&& *J/30 &&&&& *Kirby 30 &&&&& *Leigh 30 &&&&& *Mirage 30 &&&&& *Mirage 30 SX &&&&& *Nonsuch 30 &&&&& *Tanzer 31 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

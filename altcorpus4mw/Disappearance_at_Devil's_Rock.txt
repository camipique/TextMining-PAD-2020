The novel received the 2017 British Fantasy Award for best horror novel. It was nominated for the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Award for Novel in 2017. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& A thirteen-year-old boy goes missing after spending time with his friends at Borderland State Park. His family is thrown into disarray as strange events begin occurring; a mysterious apparition appears in his mother's room and discarded pages from his journal that may provide potential clues as to his whereabouts begin to surface. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& Jason Heller of NPR wrote that the novel "takes the simple premise of a lost child and twists it into a dizzying emotional vortex" and that "the most powerful aspect of 'Disappearance' ... is its immediacy. Tremblay doesn't shout or gesticulate. He whispers his tale, punctuating it with the 'clicks and whirrs' of an air conditioner or the life-mocking ring of a child's bicycle bell." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Lenz Field &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Lenz Field''' is a multi-field baseball and softball complex in Jacksonville, IL. &&&&& &&&&& The complex is privately-owned by area resident and businessman, Tom Lenz. In a typical tournament season, the complex hosts approximately thirty events, in addition to several standalone college and area high school baseball and softball games. Its estimated yearly impact on the local economy is approximately $3M, according to Jacksonville's mayor, Andy Ezard. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The complex began as a single field, built to Little League standard dimensions that was completed in June 2007, at a cost of approximately $400,000. The original field, now known as Field #4 within the complex, is entirely artificial turf. &&&&& &&&&& The following year, a large tract of land across the street from the original field was purchased by Passavant Area Hospital, which in turn sold portions of that land to Lenz, who began construction on additional fields. By May of 2009, three additional fields - now known as Field #1, Field #2, and Field #3 - were ready for play, with the original field being renamed as Field #4. The final two fields would be completed in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Lenz has told the Springfield State Journal-Register that the tax credits put in place by President George W. Bush were a key part of his ability to expand the complex. &&&&& &&&&& Lenz Field is known regionally as a facility that is rarely impacted by inclement weather, with few rained out games and the ability to quickly make its fields ready for play after a heavy downpour. &&&&& &&&&& Fields &&&&& The fields at the complex are numbered in sequence from 1-6. Field #1 is considered to be the "showcase" field in the complex and is fully artificial turf. Field #2 has an artificial turf infield and grass outfield, as does Field #5. Field #3 has an artificial turf infield and grass outfield and is designed for softball and younger age group baseball. Field #4 is the original fully artificial turf field, located across the street from the main part of the Lenz Field complex. Field #6, like Field #1, is fully artificial turf. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Lenz Field official website &&&&& * Lenz Field official Twitter page &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

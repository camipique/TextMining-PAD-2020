First Prize (album) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''First Prize''''' is an album by pianist and composer George Gruntz's Concert Jazz Band which was recorded in Switzerland in 1989 and released on the Enja label. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "This is a particularly fun outing ... both complex and full of wit and color. ... there is plenty of variety and many brilliant moments. George Gruntz's 18-piece group was one of the finest of the period, and this sometimes-eccentric CD is a perfect introduction to his music". &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& All compositions by George Gruntz except where noted &&&&& # "So Easy" (Larry Schneider) – 8:09 &&&&& # "Gorby-Chief" – 11:25 &&&&& # "Speaking of Love" – 7:47 &&&&& # "Trance-Figurations" (Franco Ambrosetti) – 5:42 &&&&& # "Amnesty" – 8:08 &&&&& # "E.B.S.B.M.O."

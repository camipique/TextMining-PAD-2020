In this second book, Villar tells the story of a close knit town on the northwest of Spain, where fisherman return to the water Monday-Saturday to fill their nets and sell their catches. Food is also an important feature to the story. The reader can almost taste the food as it is described by the locals; and speaking of locals, they are a peculiar lot of people that have their own way of living and speaking. The culture of the people plays an important role in the story. &&&&& &&&&& In Maxine Scott's review of the book she states that this is not a "complicated" book, and it was not necessary to have a multiple number of bodies to enhance the story. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''General sources:''' &&&&& &&&&& *http://www.eurocrime.co.uk/reviews/Death_on_a_Galician_Shore.html &&&&& *http://www.austcrimefiction.org/review/death-galician-shore-domingo-villar &&&&& *https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/668583400 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

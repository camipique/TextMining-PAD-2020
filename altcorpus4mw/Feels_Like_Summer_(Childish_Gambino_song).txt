It was directed by Glover, Ivan Dixon and Greg Sharp. In the animated video, Gambino walks calmly through a neighborhood watching all of his neighbors playing during the summer as well as stopping to have dream sequences. The neighbors are all famous rappers or modern black figures that consist of (in order and group): &&&&& * Lil Pump and Trippie Redd running around the neighborhood &&&&& * 21 Savage and Metro Boomin relaxing in a car &&&&& * Kodak Black sticking his head out of the window to turn away Pump and Redd &&&&& * Migos playing basketball &&&&& * Birdman grilling while Chance the Rapper watches Jaden Smith playing &&&&& * Will Smith washing his car &&&&& * Azealia Banks sitting in a tree above Smith &&&&& *Nicki Minaj playing with blocks as Travis Scott knocks them over &&&&& * The Weeknd, Ty Dolla Sign and Frank Ocean playing tug of war against ASAP Rocky, Solange Knowles and Willow Smith &&&&& * Soulja Boy speaking with Pump and Redd &&&&& * Drake trying to catch up to Future while he is riding his bike &&&&& * Kid Cudi standing with his head down &&&&& * Kanye West being comforted by Michelle Obama &&&&& * Beyoncé wearing a shirt paying tribute to Fredo Santana &&&&& * Andrew Gillum with a cup of ice cream resembling the late XXXTentacion &&&&& * Lil Uzi Vert and Zendaya having their hair done by Oprah Winfrey and Tiffany Haddish &&&&& * Lil Yachty and Charlamagne Tha God eating popcicles &&&&& * Gucci Mane lying on his back relaxing &&&&& * Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Sean Combs, Wiz Khalifa and Jay-Z dancing over Mane &&&&& * Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball playing a video game while Young Thug sits behind them &&&&& * 2 Chainz taking a group shot of Meek Mill, Pusha T and Lil Wayne &&&&& * Rae Sremmurd blasting water guns at the past three and J.

He posted a still image revealing that Andre would have worn a greenscreen bodysuit with a bird perched on his shoulder, a costume he notably wears during the "Bird Up!" segments of ''The Eric Andre Show''. &&&&& &&&&& A follow-up video shows the animated Gambino walking into his house (which seems to partially resemble, or at least invoke, ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'') and taking off his shoes to a new pair of Adidas. This was used to announce Glover's role as an ambassador and "brand co-creator" for the corporation. &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& Credits adapted from Tidal. &&&&& * Donald Glover – production, mix engineering &&&&& * Ludwig Göransson – production &&&&& * Riley Mackin – mix engineering, master engineering, record engineering &&&&& * Justin Richburg - character design, animation &&&&& * Felix Colgrave - production, animation &&&&& * Jessica Maffia - single art &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Australia (ARIA) &&&&& &&&&& 79 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) &&&&& &&&&& 9 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 25 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Release history &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Region &&&&& &&&&& Date &&&&& &&&&& Format &&&&& &&&&& Label &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Various &&&&& &&&&& July 11, 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

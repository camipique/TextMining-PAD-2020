Williams commented that "''Deathmaze 5000'' is an excellent game which will ''not'' be solved in a few weeks. If you like the prospect of a game that could last you for a ''very'' long time, get it. It's better than many more expensive games I've seen, both in price and in gaming value." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

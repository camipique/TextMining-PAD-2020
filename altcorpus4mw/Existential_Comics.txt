Existential Comics &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Existential Comics''' is a webcomic about philosophy created by Corey Mohler, a software engineer in Portland, Oregon. Mohler, who has an amateur interest in the subject rather than an academic background, created the comic in December 2013 in an attempt to help popularize philosophy through comedy. The comic tends to depict philosophers of different backgrounds and often has them interacting and arguing with each other. It also gives textual descriptions of the jokes and associated philosophy to help educate readers. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2018 Mohler drew attention from Elon Musk after calling him "the villain from ''Atlas Shrugged''". Musk angrily responded during SpaceX's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket. Mohler later published a comic about the incident. &&&&& &&&&& Philosophers &&&&& existentialists are often featured in the comic. The four here, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jean-Paul Sartre, have all been featured multiple times. &&&&& The comic has covered over 120 philosophers, examining a wide variety of thought from Pre-Socratic philosophy to contemporary philosophy. Mohler has described both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir as his favorite philosophers. Alongside existentialism, Mohler has also written extensively about Stoicism. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * ''The Partially Examined Life'' &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * http://existentialcomics.com/ &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

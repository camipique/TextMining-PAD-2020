144	GSR_Class_710
GSR Class 710 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Great Southern Railways (GSR) Class 710''' consisted of ten 0-6-0 locomotives built by Inchicore railway works in 1934. &&&&& &&&&& They were more modern than the five GSR Class 700 0-6-0 introduced in 1929 though being more modern with piston valves and a type Z superheatered boiler. They could be thought of as a tender version of the GSR Class 670 0-6-2T introduced in 1933 but with smaller wheels more suited to branch and goods work. Whilst intended as a modern addition to the 101 class they seemed to gain a reputation as poor steamers and heavy on coal and water. Following their introduction the GSR resumed rebuilding the 101 class with the Z-type superheated boiler. &&&&& &&&&& There is a detailed O Gauge model of engine 710 in the Fry model railway collection. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

273	Gibraltar_Intermediate_League
Gibraltar Intermediate League &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Gibraltar Intermediate League''' is a semi-professional football league administered by the Gibraltar Football Association, launched in June 2018 as a replacement for the Gibraltar Reserves Division and the Under 18 Division in an effort to improve the standards of young Gibraltarian footballers. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& From 2008 until 2018, reserve team football in Gibraltar had been run under the Gibraltar Reserves Division. In this league, there were no restrictions on what players could participate, and some clubs would often field numerous members of the first team in fixtures. However, on 5 June 2018, the Gibraltar Football Association announced sweeping changes to the league structure, introducing the Intermediate League. In the new league, teams can register teams of up to 18 players, of which a minimum of 13 must be eligible for the Gibraltar national football team and a maximum of 5 players can be over the age of 23. Soon after the launch of the league, it was announced that clubs in the league will be subject to a salary cap, in order to prevent larger teams from hoarding players. &&&&& &&&&& The first team to formally announce their intention to join the Intermediate League was Gibraltar Phoenix, signing 10 players for the new team on 10 June and appointing former Gibraltar under-19 and Mons Calpe manager Terrence Jolley. &&&&& &&&&& Teams for 2018-19 season &&&&& :''The following teams are anticipated to enter teams in the inaugural season as of 17 June 2018. This incomplete list is subject to change.'' &&&&& *Europa &&&&& *Gibraltar Phoenix &&&&& *Gibraltar United &&&&& *Glacis United &&&&& *Lincoln Red Imps &&&&& *Lions Gibraltar &&&&& *Lynx &&&&& *Manchester 62 &&&&& *Mons Calpe &&&&& *St Joseph's &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

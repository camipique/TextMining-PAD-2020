José Tolentino Mendonça &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Dom'' José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça''', ComSE, ComIH (born 15 December 1965), who publishes using the name '''José Tolentino Mendonça''', is a Portuguese priest of the Catholic Church who has been designated a titular archbishop and Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church as of 1 September 2018. Until his Vatican appointment, he spent his career as a university educator and administrator, theologian, and poet. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& He was born in Madeira, Portugal, on 15 December 1965. He spent part of his earliest years in Angola, leaving at the age of nine when Portugal withdrew from its African colonies. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Funchal, Madeira, on 28 July 1990. He published his first book of poems, ''Os Dias Contados'', the same year. He obtained a licentiate in theology from the Catholic University of Portugal in 1989 and a licentiate in biblical sciences at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1992. He obtained a doctorate in biblical theology from the Catholic University of Portugal in 2004. &&&&& &&&&& He has been a lecturer at the diocesan seminary of Funchal, the rector of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome, the vice rector and a lecturer at the Catholic University of Portugal, and a visiting lecturer in Brazil at the Catholic Universities of Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro and at the Faculty of Philosophy and Theology of the University Center of Belo Horizonte. &&&&& &&&&& After attending a meeting that Pope Benedict XVI held with a large group of artists in 2009, Mendonça said that the pope's gesture of hospitality was appreciated and that Benedict has signaled to the artists that "within the Church, within the Christian space, they have their home, a sort of homeland". He was awarded the 2009 Inês de Castro Foundation Literary Prize for ''O viajante sem sono'' (The Sleepless Traveler). &&&&& &&&&& He was named a consulter of the Pontifical Council for Culture in 2011. &&&&& &&&&& Pope Francis chose him to deliver a series of ten Lenten lectures to the Roman Curia in 2018. In addition to the Bible, his sermons referenced a variety of writers, including Pessoa, Roland Barthes and Clarice Lispector. He said: "Writers are important spiritual masters." He later said that he tells his bible students "that a Bible scholar, or a priest, has to see a lot of movies, has to listen to a lot of music, has to get in touch with the world of the arts." His sermons were published as ''Elogio da Sede'' with a preface by Pope Francis. &&&&& Father José Tolentino Mendonça at Capela do Rato on the 22nd of July 2018 &&&&& On 26 June 2018 Pope Francis appointed him Vatican archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church, effective 1 September, and named him titular archbishop of Suava. He was consecrated a bishop on 28 July by Manuel Clemente, Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon, assisted by Cardinal António Marto, Bishop of Leiria-Fátima, and Teodoro de Faria, Bishop Emeritus of Funchal. &&&&& &&&&& He has published numerous volumes and articles in the fields of theology and Biblical exegesis. He has won awards for his poetry as well. &&&&& &&&&& Views &&&&& He holds that Jesus did not and establish rules stating “Teresa Forcades i Vila reminds of that which is essential: that Jesus of Nazareth did not codify, nor did he establish rules, Jesus lived. That is, he constructed an ethos of relation, somatized the poetry of his message in the visibility of his flesh, expressed his own body as a premise.” The Council of Trent, on the other hand, clearly teaches that Jesus is not only a Redeemer but also a "legislator". &&&&& &&&&& Writings &&&&& ;Poetry &&&&& * ''De Igual para Igual'' (2000) &&&&& * ''A Estrada Branca'' (2005) &&&&& * ''A Noite abre os meus Olhos'' (2006) &&&&& * ''O Viajante sem Sono'' (2009) &&&&& * ''Estação Central'' (2012) &&&&& * ''A Papoila e o Monge'' (2013) &&&&& &&&&& ;Theology &&&&& * ''A construção de Jesus.

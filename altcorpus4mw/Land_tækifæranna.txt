In the assessment of Katrín Jakobsdóttir; The community divide suits Ævar well and he is on great form in this book, creating a nice plot around the murdered Pole and the financier (''útrásarvíkingur''), and clearly enjoys putting words into the mouths of his characters when he constructs dialogues about the situation. ''Land of Opportunities'' thus testifies well to what good effects he has achieved in the form, and at the same time he has distinguished himself with a sharp social commentary and well established subject matter. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * Icelandic literature &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

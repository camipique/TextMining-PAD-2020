1487	HMS_Lark_(1913)
HMS Lark (1913) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''HMS ''Lark''''' was a of the British Royal Navy. The ''Laforey'' class (or L class) was the class of destroyers ordered under the Royal Navy's 1912–1913 construction programme, which were armed with three guns and four torpedo tubes and were capable of . The ship, which was originally to be named ''Haughty'' but was renamed before launch, was built by the Scottish shipbuilder Yarrow between 1912 and 1913. &&&&& &&&&& ''Lark'' served during the First World War. She formed part of the Harwich Force in the early years of the war, taking part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914, the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915. &&&&& &&&&& Construction and design &&&&& For the 1912–1913 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy, the British Admiralty ordered twenty destroyers to a design based on a modified version of the previous year's , with the major difference being an increased torpedo armament of four torpedo tubes rather than two. Four of the destroyers were ordered from Yarrow, with four more from Fairfield, and two each from Denny, Parsons, Swan Hunter, Thornycroft, White and Beardmore. &&&&& &&&&& The destroyers were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement of the class ranged from at normal load and at deep load, with ''Lark'' having a normal displacement of . Three Yarrow boilers fed two sets of Brown-Curtis impulse steam turbines. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ship had two funnels. &&&&& &&&&& The ships were armed with three QF Mk IV guns, with a single Maxim machine gun. Two twin torpedo tubes were fitted. The ships were built with fittings to carry four mines, but these were never used. The ship's crew was 73 officers and ratings. Wartime modifications included the addition of a 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom anti-aircraft autocannon, the provision of depth charges, which may have resulted in one of the ship's guns and a pair of torpedo tubes being removed in 1918 to accommodate an outfit of 30–50 depth charges, while the ship was also modified to allow a kite balloon to be operated. &&&&& &&&&& The first of the four Yarrow-built destroyers, ''Haughty'' was laid down at Yarrow's Scotstoun yard on 28 June 1912. On 30 September 1913, the 1912–1913 destroyers, which were previously to be known as the ''Rob Roy'' class, were redesignated the L or ''Laforey'' class, with the ships given new names string with the letter L. ''Haughty'' was renamed ''Lark''. ''Lark'' was launched on 26 May 1913 and completed in November that year. &&&&& &&&&& Service &&&&& ===1914=== &&&&& ''Lark'', like the rest of the ''Laforey'' class, joined the Harwich Force at the outbreak of the First World War. On 5 August 1914, the Third Destroyer Flotilla, led by the light cruiser and including ''Lark'', carried out a sweep to prevent German minelayers or torpedo craft entering the English Channel. Later that morning, the flotilla leader  and sister ship were ordered ahead of the flotilla to investigate, and came across the German minelayer , laying mines off Southwold on the Sussex coast. The German ship attempted to escape to neutral waters, but was engaged and sunk by ''Lance'', ''Landrail'' and ''Amphion''. The flotilla was returning from the sweep in 6 August when it ran into the minefield laid by ''Königin Luise''. ''Amphion'' struck a mine and began to sink, her crew abandoning ship, but drifted onto another mine, with debris from the resulting explosion hitting ''Lark'' killing two of ''Amphion''s crew that had just been rescued as well as a prisoner from ''Königin Luise''. In total, 151 of ''Amphion''s crew were killed. On 28 August 1914, the Harwich Force, supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. ''Lark'' formed part of the 2nd Division of the Third Flotilla during this operation. ''Lark'' took part in torpedo attacks against the German light cruisers , and , expending all her torpedoes and 4-inch ammunition, requiring her to borrow 100 rounds of 4-inch ammunition from . &&&&& &&&&& On 24 October 1914, ''Lark'' set out from Harwich as part of the escort for the seaplane carriers and on a raid against the German airship base at Cuxhaven. The force reached the launch-off point off Heligoland on the morning of 25 October, but poor weather meant that only two of the six seaplanes managed to take-off, both of which quickly abandoned the mission. &&&&& &&&&& On 2 November 1914, the light cruiser , together with ''Lark'' and the destroyers and , left Harwich to patrol on the Broad Fourteens in search of German submarines. The course of the force took it between British and German minefields, and the force encountered many floating mines which had broken adrift from the two minefields. ''Lark'' destroyed six mines, with 15 mines being destroyed by the force during the day. At the same time, German battlecruisers were carrying out a raid on the east coast of England, and on the morning of 3 November, carried out a brief bombardment of Yarmouth. Both ''Lark''s force, and another small force of destroyers, led by the light cruiser , were ordered to make for Terschelling off the Dutch coast, with the hope of cutting off the Germans from their bases, while the main force of the Harwich Force would leave Harwich as soon as it had raised steam. The German force avoided interception, and returned to Germany. &&&&& &&&&& On 15 December 1914, the Germans staged a raid with their battlecruisers against the British East Coast towns of Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool. Warned by the codebreakers of Room 40, th British ordered a force of batlecruisers and battleships, together with the light cruisers of the Harwich Force, to intercept the Germans. ''Lark'' fouled a bouy when leaving Harwich harbour, so did not sail with the Harwich Force. The British forces again failed to intercept the German raiders. &&&&& &&&&& ===1915–1916=== &&&&& On 23 January 1915, the German battlecruisers under Admiral Franz von Hipper made a sortie to attack British fishing boats on the Dogger Bank. British Naval Intelligence was warned of the raid by radio messages decoded by Room 40, and sent out the Battlecruiser Force from Rosyth, commanded by Admiral Beatty aboard and the Harwich Force, commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt aboard the light cruiser were sent out to intercept the German force. ''Lark'' was part of the 4th Division of the Third Flotilla when it sailed as part of the Harwich Force. The majority of the destroyers of the Harwich Force, including ''Lark'', were not fast enough to keep up with the battlecruisers. Only seven destroyers of the M class were fast enough to engage the German warships. &&&&& &&&&& On 1 May 1915, the German submarine torpedoed and sank the old British destroyer near the Galloper Light Vessel, off the Thames Estuary. Four destroyers of the Harwich Force, ''Lark'', , ''Lawford'' and ''Leonidas'' set out to hunt for ''Recruit''s assailant. Meanwhile, two German torpedo boats, and , which had been searching for a German floatplane which had ditched, encountered four British trawlers near the North Hinder. One of the trawlers, was sunk by a German torpedo, but the remaining three trawlers survived, with the two German torpedo boats, breaking off the attack when the four British destroyers of the ''Lark'' group approached. The torpedo boats, which were small coastal boats of the , which were outclassed by the British ships, attempted to flee to neutral waters, but were soon caught and sunk by gunfire. In June 1915, most of the Harwich Force, including ''Lark'' was employed in ant-submarine operations at the west end of the English Channel, covering the arrival of troops from Canada and the despatch of troops to the Dardanelles campaign. &&&&& &&&&& In the summer of 1915, the 3rd Flotilla was renamed the Ninth Destroyer Flotilla. On 20 February 1916, part of the Ninth Flotilla, including ''Lark'' set out from Harwich to cover minesweeping operations. ''Lark'' collided with sister ship shortly after leaving Harwich, and the two destroyers, accompanied by , had to return to Harwich. On 3 May 1916, ''Lark'' escorted the minelayer on Operation XX, a combined minelaying operation by ''Princess Margaret'' and the destroyer minelayer and air raid by seaplanes from ''Engadine'' and against the German airship base at Tondern. The minefields were successfully laid without German interference, although the light cruiser and , supporting the operation, shot down the German airship ''L 7''. &&&&& &&&&& On 1 June 1916, the Harwich Force sortied to reinforce the Grand Fleet following the Battle of Jutland. ''Lark'' was one of eight destroyers detached to screen the damaged battleship , which had been torpedoed during the battle, helping to escort the battleship to the Humber for temporary repair. On 5 September 1916, ''Lark'' and were deployed to the English Channel to escort ''Princess Victoria'', carrying a load of Gold bullion from Cherbourg to Portsmouth. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

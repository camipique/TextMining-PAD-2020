Laurens-Marathon Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Laurens-Marathon Community School District''' is a school district headquartered in Laurens, Iowa, and also serving Marathon. The district occupies sections of Buena Vista, Clay, Palo Alto, and Pocahontas counties. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& It formed on July 1, 1976 by the merger of the Laurens Community School District and the Marathon Community School District. &&&&& &&&&& On July 1, 2010, the South Clay Community School District was dissolved, and Laurens-Marathon received portions of the district. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014 the South Central Calhoun Community School District, a district not contiguous with Laurens-Marathon, entered a superintendent-sharing agreement. The shared superintendent was Jeff Kruse. &&&&& &&&&& The district began partial-day sharing, in which students from one district went to another district for some classes, with the Pocahontas Community School District around 2015. &&&&& &&&&& Kruse was scheduled to leave at the end of the 2016-2017 school year. Scott Williamson became the new superintendent in July 2017. That year the L-M and Pocahontas districts began whole grade-sharing, in which one district sent its children to another district for certain grade levels. L-M had multiple classes it was required to have in order to maintain high school grades, but insufficient numbers of students were enrolled in them. As a result, Laurens-Marathon sent its high school students to Pocahontas high school. Around that time period Laurens-Marathon elementary school students had, as part of a preliminary indication, increased test scores. &&&&& &&&&& School &&&&& &&&&& The current by gymnasium opened in September 1998. The previous by gymnasium, built in the early 1940s, was called "The Barn". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Laurens-Marathon Community School District &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

The Eisenhower course opened in November 1979, and when built had eight lakes and 108 sand traps. The Zaharias course opened the following year with 52 sand traps. It is a shorter but narrower course than Eisenhower. &&&&& &&&&& The course was built with a trolley-like funicular to transport golfers and carts up a steep hill at the finish of the 36th hole. The trolley runs to a snack bar that at one time held the rail car that carried the body of Winston Churchill at his funeral (the car was returned to Britain in 2007). The club also housed a golf library which was the only public golf library in the west, and only one of two in the United States. &&&&& &&&&& The California Open moved to Industry Hills in 1980.

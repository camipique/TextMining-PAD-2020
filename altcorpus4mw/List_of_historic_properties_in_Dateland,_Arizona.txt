It was once the home of two World War II training camps, Camp Horn and Camp Hyder. The town also served as the home to the Dateland Army Air Fiel, a World War II United States Army Air Forces training airfield. &&&&& &&&&& Brief history &&&&& The Oatman Mountain was formed from multiple lava flows from a series of vents that over time, built the peak into the shield shape. The mountain was named after the Oatman family who were massacred nearby by the Apaches in the 1850s. &&&&& &&&&& Three of the prehistoric cultures which are believed to have resided in the Sears Point, located in the area surrounding Dateland, are the Desert Archaic, Patayan and Hohokam’s. They lived in the area between 10, 000 B.C. and 1,450 A.D.. Evidence of their existence can be found in the hundreds of symbolic and artistic rock etchings in the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site. The ancient Natibe-Americans obviously used the Gila to hunt, fish and farm &&&&& When European settlers arrived in the region the area was home to the Tonto and Yavapai Apache tribes. One of the first European expeditions into the area was led by Juan Bautista de Anza. The explorer set forth from Tubac and headed west towards California. During his travels in the Yuma area he established good relations with the Yuma tribes. The trail in the Dateland area is now known as the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. &&&&& &&&&& Mormon Trail &&&&& Mormon Battalion Trail marker in Oatman Flats, Dateland, Az. &&&&& Arizona belonged to Mexico until the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. In 1846, President Polk, authorized the army to recruit 500 Mormons to join their forces in the war with Mexico. The Mormon Battalion was mustered into service on July 16, 1846, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Although the battalion was prepared to engage the enemy if necessary, the Mormon Battalion did not find an occasion to fire their weapons in combat. The government wanted to establish a southern route to California, as the northern route was impassable up to 9 months of each year due to snow in the mountains. The Battalion came through the area on December 30, 1846 with 25 wagons and road building equipment under the command of Stephan W. Kearney. They completed a 700-mile trail between New Mexico and California. The trail established by the battalion became known as the Mormon Battalion Trail. &&&&& Oatman Family Masacre site &&&&& &&&&& The Oatman family were members of the Mormon faith who left Independence, Missouri in August 1850, and headed towards California on the Butterfield Stage Road. They were attacked by the Apaches in March 1851. Royce and Mary Oatman and four of their seven children were murdered. The Apaches took two of the girls, 14 year old Olive and 7 rear old Mary Ann. They left one of the boys, Lorenzo, for dead. The girls were eventually sold to the Mohave's. The girls werre accepted as members of the Mohave. Mary Ann died while in captivity and Olive was released by the Mohave's after her brother Lorenzo found out that she was still alive and where she was living. The site where nine members of the Oatman family are buried is located close to the Oatman Massacre site on Oatman Road in Dateland. &&&&& &&&&& Butterfield Overland Mail Trail &&&&& Ruins of the Southern Overland Trail stage stop station built by William FourrInside the Nate Salsbury house ruins &&&&& The Mormon Battalion Trail was later used by the Butterfield Overland Mail Route.

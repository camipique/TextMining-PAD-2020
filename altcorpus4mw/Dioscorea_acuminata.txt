95	Dioscorea_acuminata
Dioscorea acuminata &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Dioscorea acuminata''''' is a herbaceous vine in the genus ''Dioscorea'', which is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List. It is indigenous to the central plateau of Madagascar where it occurs on rocky substrate in a grassland-woodland mosaic habitat. There is confusion as to whether the tuber is harvested for consumption by humans as field researchers likely misidentified ''Dioscorea maciba'' as this species. However, the IUCN Red List also has an entry for ''D. maciba'' which does not cite that species as being consumed by humans. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

76	Euler_measure
Euler measure &&&&& Introduction &&&&& In measure theory, the '''Euler measure''' of a polyhedral set equals the Euler integral of its indicator function. &&&&& &&&&& The magnitude of an Euler measure &&&&& &&&&& By induction, it is easy to show that independent of dimension, the Euler measure of a closed bounded convex polyhedron always equals 1, while the Euler measure of a ''d''-D relative-open bounded convex polyhedron is . &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * Measure theory &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * ''Exponentiation and Euler measure'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

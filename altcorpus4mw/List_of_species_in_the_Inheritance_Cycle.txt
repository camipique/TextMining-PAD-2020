List of species in the Inheritance Cycle &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& This is a '''List of species in the Inheritance Cycle''', a fantasy book series by Christopher Paolini. In the Inheritance Cycle there are many made up species, including some we've never even heard of before. &&&&& &&&&& Many species were already invented such as elves and dragons, while some Christopher Paolini invented, such as the Ra'zac and their parents, the Lethrblaka. This list has all of them. &&&&& &&&&& Humans &&&&& Humans originally came to Alagaësia in the year 5596 A.C. (After Creation (Dwarf calendar)). Twenty warriors met with the dwarves and traded then sailed away again. By the time King Palancar brought with him the entire Broddring Nation in 7203 A.C., rumors of the dwarves had grown increasingly exaggerated. The Broddrings landed in the Spine, establishing Kuasta. Upon discovering Teirm, an elven city, the elves explained which land belonged to whom. Although King Palancar was intimidated by the elves, that did not stop him from trying to take over them. The elves defeated him and banished him as king. Then they built the tower of Edoc'sil, later renamed Ristvak'baen, to keep watch over him. Six years after King Palancar arrived, a ship followed the Broddrings to Alagaësia. They had black skin, and they colonized in Surda and the Hadarac Desert. &&&&& &&&&& Humans now live in all regions of the mainland except for the Hadarac Desert, save for nomadic tribes, Du Weldenvarden, the Beor Mountains, and the Spine. All humans speak Common. They are one of the only two species, along with Urgals, to exist elsewhere besides Alagaësia. Some main human characters are Ajihad, Angela the herbalist, Brom, Elva Farseer, Eragon Shadeslayer, King Galbatorix, King Orrin, Jeod Longshanks, Jörmundur, Murtagh Kingkiller, Queen Nasuada, Roran Stronghammer, The Twins, and Trianna. &&&&& &&&&& Elves &&&&& Elves, or ''alfakyn'', came to Alagaësia in the year 5217 A.C., from a land called Alalëa, which most likely means "a melancholy dream of great beauty," to escape the consequences of some terrible mistake. They then made another great mistake, to kill a dragon. The following war ended only when an elf named Eragon found a dragon egg. He named the dragon Bid'daum and when Bid'daum had grown up, they convinced the elves and the dragons to form the Dragon Riders. At first the Dragon Riders were a means of communication between elves and dragons, but soon they became peacemakers for all of Alagaësia. Later, humans were added to the Riders. Being exposed to the dragons for so long affected all of the elves. They became immortal, though they can still die in combat, and gained inhuman speed, strength, and senses. In addition, every elf became adept at magic. When Galbatorix seized the Empire, the elves abandoned many of their cities and fled to Du Weldenvarden, or the Guarding Forest. &&&&& &&&&& Elves now remain hidden in Du Weldenvarden. They are exceptionally beautiful, giving them the name the Fair Folk. They refuse to eat meat, although they used to. Courtesy is an important role in their lives, as a grudge could last millennia and escalate over time. They sing their houses from the trees, and they speak the ancient language. Some main elven characters are Arya-dröttning, Eragon Shadeslayer (He was changed during the once-a-century Agaeti Blödhren, or Blood-Oath Celebration), Oromis-elda, Queen Islanzadí, and Rhunön-elda. &&&&& &&&&& Dwarves &&&&& Dwarves, or ''Knurlan'', meaning ''those of stone'', believe that Helzvog, the god of stone, made the first dwarf from the roots of a mountain. The dwarf calendar begins with what they believe as Helzvog creating the dwarves, in the plains. Shortly after dwarves came to Alagaësia, there was an abrupt climate change, turning the plains into the Hadarac Desert, and forcing the dwarves to move to the Beor Mountains, where the first dwarf king, Korgan, discovered Farthen Dûr one day while mining. After that, hardly anything changed, and the dwarves continued to thrive and build cities in the Beor Mountains. &&&&& &&&&& Dwarves live in thirteen different clans, called Dûrgrimstnz, though, for the time being Dûrgrimst As Sweldn Rak Anhuin is being shunned for attempting to kill Eragon. Each Dûrgrimst has a Grimstborith (Clan chief), and Grimstcarvlorss (Arranger of the house). The king is called the Grimstnzborith. Dwarves love stone because of their religious beliefs, and the worst insult you could call a dwarf is "''Menknurlan''," which means "''without stone''." Some main dwarf characters are King Hrothgar and King Orik. &&&&& &&&&& Urgals &&&&& Urgals, or ''Urgralgra'', meaning ''those with horns'', landed in Alagaësia sometime between 5296 (end of the Dragon War) and 5596 (when humans first visited Alagaësia). They signed many peace treaties, but because young rams needed battles in which to prove themselves, they could not last. The Urgals declared war on the elves and dwarves. The Riders razed their villages and banished them to the Spine, where they continued to decline until the Fall of the Riders. &&&&& &&&&& Urgals have long been misunderstood. They are hunted by dwarves, humans, and elves, who call them "monsters." While Urgals have an unfortunate war-based ranking system, they're not monsters, and they play an important part in Galbatorix's downfall. Urgals that are over eight feet tall are called Kull. One important Urgal is Nar Garzhvog, who allied with the Varden. &&&&& &&&&& Dragons &&&&& Dragons were born in the Hadarac Desert, where they lived alone, wild, without language or culture, and they communicated through feelings and images. It was only when they bonded to elves that they began to have these things. In return, they gave elves and human Riders strength, speed, and sharper senses, plus immortality and magic. In addition, any humans would slowly gain pointed ears, like an elf. When dragons had eggs, they were sometimes bonded with the Riders. If that happened, the egg would not hatch until the right human or elf came into contact with it. Left alone, the egg would usually hatch when there was a sufficient amount of food. The size of the egg would depend on the size of the mother. Dragons also had something called the Eldunarí, or the Heart of Hearts. Usually the Eldunarí would remain clear, like a crystal. However, if a dragon chose so, they could place their consciousness in the Eldunarí, and it would turn the color of the dragon's scales and start to glow. If a dragon suffered body death, but they had put their consciousness in their Eldunarí, then they would continue to live on, and see the world from others' thoughts. Although dragons are creatures that are magical, the only magic they use consciously are flying and fire breathing. Other than that, dragons could only use magic in very special circumstances. Some main dragon characters are Glaedr, Saphira Bjartskular, Shruikan, Thorn, and Umaroth. &&&&& &&&&& Werecats &&&&& Werecats are creatures that can take the form of a cat or a human. They speak both Common and cat language, and they can also communicate with their thoughts. They also command the one-shapes (cats). Despite being a little rude, werecats give lots of good advice, and to ignore one would be folly. Some important werecats are King Grimrr Halfpaw and Solembum. &&&&& &&&&& Ra'zac/Lethrblaka &&&&& The Ra'zac are creatures of darkness with a humped exoskeleton, beady eyes, and beaks. They are rumored to have followed the Broddrings to Alagaësia. When they turn twenty years old, they reach adulthood, and they shed their exoskeleton and turn into Lethrblaka, terrifying creatures with vast leathery wings. The Ra'zac and their parents used to live in Helgrind, the Gates of Death, before they were killed by Eragon, Roran, and Saphira. They also destroyed two eggs, but Galbatorix, before his death, said that there were more eggs, though not where he hid them. &&&&& &&&&& Spirits &&&&& Spirits are beings of pure energy that can take many different forms and do amazing things with magic. Occasionally they are known to possess a human, creating a Shade. Spirits are ''not'' dead souls. &&&&& &&&&& Shades &&&&& A Shade is created when evil spirits possess a human weaker than themselves. Often it is because a sorcerer allows spirits to control him. Sometimes it occurs by accident if a sorcerer summons spirits that are stronger than themselves. Shades have red eyes, red hair, white skin, and are immensely powerful. They are extremely, strong, fast, and gifted at magic, and they are very good at controlling other people's thoughts. In addition, they can only be killed with a stab through the heart. Anything other than that and they will disappear, only to reappear again, stronger than before. &&&&& &&&&& Other Creatures &&&&& *Elf Horse: Horses that the elves ride, they are intelligent and will respond to commands in the ancient language. &&&&& *Feldûnost: Frostbeard, a species of goat native to the Beor Mountains. Many dwarves ride Feldûnost. &&&&& *Fanghur: A species native to the Beor Mountains, they're related to dragons, but they're not as intelligent and can't breathe fire. They use their minds to immobilize their prey before attacking. &&&&& *Íllgrathr: Meaning ''bad hunger'', more commonly known as burrow grubs. When burrowing into skin, they cause much pain and can cause a person to go mad. They can also split into many green centipedes. Created by Thuviel's explosion. &&&&& *Nagra: A giant boar native to the Beor Mountains &&&&& *Nïdwhalar: Sea serpents, cousins to the dragons and Fanghur, they can't fly or breathe fire, but like the Fanghur, they use their minds when hunting. &&&&& *Shrrg: A giant wolf native to the Beor Mountains. &&&&& *Snalglí: Giant snails that lived on Vroengard for many years but were affected by Thuviel's self-sacrifice. &&&&& *Sundavrblaka: Shadow-flapper, shadowy birds created by the energy left over from Thuviel's self-sacrifice. &&&&& *Unknown, Werewolf?: A wolf that turns into a person &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

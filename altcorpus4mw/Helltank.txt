107	Helltank
Helltank &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''''Helltank''''' is a 1981 board game published by Metagaming Concepts. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& ''Helltank'' is a game in which the map shows a city, wooded hills, a canal, and a highway, and players pick a scenario and a time period. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& W. G. Armintrout reviewed ''Helltank'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 49. Armintrout commented that "''Helltank'' got shortchanged somewhere in production. I do like the game, but I can recommend it only for experienced gamers who don't mind second-guessing the rules on a few vital points and who don't mind doing mental bookkeeping. Too bad - this game ''could'' have been a contender." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

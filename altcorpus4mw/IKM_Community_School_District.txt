IKM Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''IKM Community School District''' was a school district headquartered in Manilla. The district name referred to the municipalities of Irwin, Kirkman, and Manilla. In addition to the aforementioned cities, it also served Aspinwall. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& It was formed on July 1, 1992 by the merger of the Irwin and Manilla school districts. &&&&& &&&&& In fall 2008 the IKM district and the Manning Community School District began whole grade-sharing, in which one district sent its students to another district's school for the whole day. This arrangement meant that the two districts consolidated their students into each others' schools. &&&&& &&&&& On July 1, 2011 it merged with the Manning district to form the IKM-Manning Community School District. The merger vote, held on Tuesday April 6, 2010, was in favor of consolidation: the vote tallies were 206-26 at the Irwin polling station and 190-20 at the Manilla polling station, while in Manning the tally was 477-20. &&&&& &&&&& Schools &&&&& The district operated an elementary school in Irwin, and a high school in Manilla. &&&&& &&&&& Irwin Consolidated School was formerly in operation. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

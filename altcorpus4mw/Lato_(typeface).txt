218	Lato_(typeface)
Lato (typeface) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lato''' is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Łukasz Dziedzic. It was released in 2015. The name "Lato" is Polish for "summer". &&&&& &&&&& As of August 2018, Lato is used on more than 9.6 million websites, and is the third most served font on Google Fonts, with over one billion views per day. &&&&& &&&&& Use &&&&& Lato has been used in various physical publications, including information signs and election campaign billboards. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& Lato was created in 2010 for a Polish bank by Łukasz Dziedzic. When the bank changed its stylistic vision, he shelved the typeface, and released it later that year under the libre SIL Open Font License. &&&&& &&&&& After Lato was added to Google Fonts it quickly gained popularity, becoming the third most used web font after Google's own Roboto and Open Sans, with over one billion views per day as of August 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Language support &&&&& It supports all Latin alphabets, along with Cyrillic, Greek, and IPA. &&&&& &&&&& Derivatives &&&&& &&&&& The Lato typeface is available in nine weights from hairline to black, each of which has a distinct italic variant. Each of these 18 variants is additionally available in a LatoLatin version, containing just the subset of glyphs required for European languages based on the Latin alphabet; this allows for smaller file sizes. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

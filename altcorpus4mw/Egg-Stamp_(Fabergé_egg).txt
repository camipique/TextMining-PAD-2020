The quality of the execution of the Cherubs, the elaboration of details, incusing and engraving – at the ideal level. Stamps for individuals were seldom executed on an individual commission, most of the stamps made by Faberge company for members of the Imperial Family. The cost of engraving was fathomless higher than the cost of the material. There are job prices: the cost of an agate matrix is 3 roubles, engraving of a stamps – 50 roubles. &&&&& &&&&& Even in the Faberge firm of master engravers of the highest qualification there were only a few people. &&&&& &&&&& The stamp in Petrograd was obtained by a Finnish enterpriser, a grain bargainer and transported to Finland by its owner during the October Revolution of 1917.

List of birds of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& This is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species recorded in Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, which is in the U.S. state of Colorado. Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). As of December 2016, the checklist contained 175 species. Between that date and July 2018, 15 species have been added through eBird. &&&&& &&&&& This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the ''Check-list of North American Birds'', 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the ''Check-list''. &&&&& The following codes and definitions are used to annotate some species. The others are residents and regular migrants which a visitor can expect to see in the proper season and habitat. &&&&& &&&&& *(PP) = '''Probably present''' - "High confidence species occurs in park but current, verified evidence needed" per the NPS (49 species) &&&&& *(R) = '''Rare''' - "Present, but usually seen only a few times each year" per the NPS (38 species) &&&&& *(O) = '''Occasional''' - "Occurs in the park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year" per the NPS (26 species) &&&&& *(Unk) = '''Unknown''' - "Abundance unknown" per the NPS (two species) &&&&& *(I) = '''Introduced''' - a species introduced to North America by humans (six species) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ducks, geese, and waterfowl &&&&& Canada goose &&&&& Female mallard in flight. &&&&& Pair of green-winged teals, male at rear. &&&&& Pair of hooded mergansers, male at rear. &&&&& '''Order''': Anseriformes'''Family''': Anatidae &&&&& &&&&& The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

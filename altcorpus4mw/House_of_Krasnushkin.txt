The part of 141 quarters from Kommerchesky Lane corner in 1879 belonged to Zachariah Egorovich Krasnushkin (1816—1892), the honorary hereditary citizen of Taganrog. Zakhary Krasnushkin coming from a noble Cossack sort served from the colonel's rank to the general, the army foreman Oblasti Voysk of Donskoy. Having got this manor in the center of Taganrog, Zakhary Krasnushkin built two two-storeyed houses on this site: Petrovsky 7 at the corner and, in the neighborhood, Petrovsky 9 (in old numbering). The forged gate which conducted to the general farmstead divided two houses. &&&&& &&&&& Since 1871 Krasnushkin kept in this house shop from St. Petersburg Manufactory Company. Traded in men's and ladies' shirts, jackets from a shooting, scarfs nasal, simple and batiste, other quick-selling goods. In the same years the shop of the German silver products Gennigera placed on a leasehold basis where German silver vases for pancakes were in special demand was famous; trade A. M. Valera Bielefeld, selling fabrics from pure linen, and manufactory shop of M. S. Beshtavov. &&&&& &&&&& In 1911 in a farmstead of this house, the steam dye-house and a workshop on cleaning of clothes belonging to Danziger were located. &&&&& &&&&& In 1926 a half of the building was occupied by N.K.

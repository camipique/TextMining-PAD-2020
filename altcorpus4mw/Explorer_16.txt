Explorer 16 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Explorer 16''', also called '''S-55B''', was an American satellite launched as part of Explorers program. Explorer 16 as launched on December 19, 1962, on Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia, United States, with a Scout rocket. &&&&& &&&&& Mission &&&&& Explorer 16 was the second in the series of micrometeoroid satellites orbited by NASA. Its purpose was to obtain data on the near-earth meteoroid environment, thus providing an accurate estimate of the probability of penetration in spacecraft structures by meteoroids and allowing a more confident definition of the relationship between penetration flux and material thickness to be derived. &&&&& &&&&& The cylindrically shaped spacecraft, about , was built around the burned-out fourth stage of the Scout launch vehicle that remained as part of the orbiting satellite. Explorer 16 carried stainless steel pressurized-cell penetration detectors, impact detectors, capacitor detectors, and cadmium sulfide cell detectors to obtain data on the size, number, distribution, and momentum of dust particles in the near-earth environment. The spacecraft operated satisfactorily during its 7-month life (December 16, 1962, to July 1963), and all mission objectives were accomplished. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

2072	Love_Yourself:_Answer
Love Yourself: Answer &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Love Yourself 結 'Answer'''''' (stylized as '''''LOVE YOURSELF 結 'Answer'''''') is the third Korean-language compilation album by South Korean boy band BTS. The album was released on August 24, 2018 by Big Hit Entertainment and is available in 4 different versions: S, E, L, and F. The album contains twenty-five tracks (twenty-six for digital version), including seven new songs, with the track "Idol" serving as the lead single. Most tracks are from ''Love Yourself: Her'', and ''Love Yourself: Tear'', including some remixes. The album debuted at number one in South Korea, Canada, Japan and the United States, becoming BTS' second chart-topping album in the US market. &&&&& &&&&& On November 9, 2018 ''Love Yourself: Answer'' became the first Korean album to be gold certified in the United States. &&&&& &&&&& Background and release &&&&& ''Answer'' was first announced on July 16, 2018, with the announcement of the album containing seven new tracks coming the following day. The album was designed as the finale of the ''Love Yourself'' series, which connected the story plot of short film ''Love Yourself 起 Wonder,'' EP ''Love Yourself 承 'Her''', and studio album ''Love Yourself 轉 'Tear''', forming the "起承轉結 (기승전결) (Kishōtenketsu)" storytelling composition. &&&&& &&&&& Two versions of BTS' Jin in the "Epiphany" comeback trailer, representing a personal journey. &&&&& On August 6, Big Hit Entertainment released a ''Most Beautiful Moment in Life'' note, part of a series of fictional notes pertaining to the concept of BTS' albums, starting with their 2015 EP ''The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1''. The note, written by BTS member Jin, spoke about him finding a notebook written by his father in the story. The book discussed the father's failures. Three days later, on August 9, the trailer for the album, featuring a new song entitled "Epiphany", was released. The solo, described by ''Billboard'''s Tamar Herman as a "building pop-rock melody", was performed by Jin, and speaks about finding self-love. The song serves as one of the tracks for the album. The trailer was directed by Yong-seok Choi (Lumpens), and portrays multiple versions of Jin in a room, telling the story of a personal journey. Philip Merrill of the Recording Academy described the video as having a "sense of going backward and forward, through time and through different versions of one's self". Discussing Jin's performance of the video, Hong Hye-min of ''The Korea Times'' stated that it was well-acted and emotional, with Jin's "sorrowful, free voice standing out". &&&&& &&&&& Promotional concept photos presenting four different themes were released on August 13 for the "S" and "E" versions, and August 16 for the "L" and "F" versions. Version "S" contained elements inspired by New Romanticism, with BTS in bright red boxes surrounded by cameras, eyes, hands, and amplifiers. Concept version "E" contained bright pastels, with BTS members in bubbles filled with fantastical nature elements. The second set of teasers, versions "L" and "F", were brighter, with BTS members wearing a mix of retro streetwear and formal blazers and suits. In addition, version "L" contained black-and-white images, collaged with the contrasting bright photographs. The official tracklist was released on August 20, revealing that it would be a compilation album containing songs from ''Love Yourself: Her'' and ''Love Yourself: Tear'', with a total of twenty-five tracks. The tracklist also announced remixed versions of BTS' previous singles "DNA", "Mic Drop" and "Fake Love". On August 22, 2018, the teaser for "Idol" was released. On August 24, two hours before the release of ''Love Yourself: Answer'', Big Hit Entertainment announced that an alternative version of "Idol" featuring Nicki Minaj will be included in the digital version of the album. Afterwards, the album was released, along with the music video for "Idol". A music video for the Nicki Minaj version of "Idol" was later released on September 6, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& Some of the album's themes include empowerment, youth, love, and reflection while the moods exhibited through the album are cathartic, lively, confident, passionate, and yearning among many other things. The genre of the album showcases various types of pop. &&&&& &&&&& In an interview with ''Billboard'' some of the producer's that helped with the album recalled their thought processes and aims for the album. Writer Melanie Fontana, who worked on "Euphoria", wanted the chorus to explode with something more "chanty" but the crowd could sing along easily too. Ray Michael Djan Jr. stated that the song "I'm Fine" was a response to an earlier song he helped write called "Save Me". A lot of drum and bass influenced "I'm Fine" and they blended a lot of different sounds to create it. On the title song "Idol", Ali Tamposi stated the rep from Big Hit wanted the song to feel intense. &&&&& &&&&& Promotion &&&&& KBS' ''Music Bank'' to perform on August 31, 2018. &&&&& &&&&& On August 26, 2018, BTS held a press conference discussing the album, as well as the BTS World Tour: Love Yourself, which began the previous day. They performed "Idol" and "I'm Fine" on various South Korean music shows for the week of August 26 with prerecorded performances airing the following week, including ''M Countdown'', ''Music Bank'', ''Show! Music Core'', and ''Inkigayo''. A shortened version of "Save Me" from ''The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever'' served as an intro track during the "I'm Fine" performance on ''M Countdown''. BTS performed "Idol" at the second Soribada Best K-Music Awards on August 30, with "Fake Love" sung as an encore performance. &&&&& &&&&& While in the United States for the North American leg of their ''Love Yourself'' tour, BTS performed "Idol" on the second semifinal episode of ''America's Got Talent'' season thirteen, which aired on September 12. The band sang "Idol" on ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' and ''Good Morning America'' on September 25 and 26 respectively, in addition to a sit-down interview on both shows. A bonus performance of "I'm Fine" was also released on ''The Tonight Show''s YouTube channel. &&&&& &&&&& On October 1, 2018, news surfaced that BTS were scheduled to appear on the BBC's ''The Graham Norton Show'' on October 12, which was later confirmed by Big Hit Entertainment five days later. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& ''Love Yourself: Answer'' received positive reviews from critics. Nemo Kim from the ''South China Morning Post'' gave the album four stars out of five and said, "BTS rappers show their chops on solo tracks, band send a message to Korean youth about self-love, and single Idol sees them don traditional garb and blend pop with ancient percussion as Minaj joins in," praising the album as "cementing BTS' place as kings of the genre". In a positive review, Taylor Glasby of ''Clash'' magazine described the narrative of the album as a "portrayal of the fears, mistakes and thoughts we inflict on ourselves" which remain "poignantly relatable". In addition, she said that the narrative serves "to remind us that each person must make their own path, and there's no one size fits all answer to achieving self-acceptance". However, for "Answer: Love Myself", the track concluding the narrative on the album, Glasby felt that it "lyrically exceeds although plays the instrumental a little too safe". Tamar Herman of ''Billboard'' praised the album, calling it a "masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning, ''Answer'' is undeniably a magnum opus from BTS that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve." &&&&& &&&&& Accolades &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +Year-end lists &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Critic/Publication &&&&& &&&&& List &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& Ref. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''20 minutos'' &&&&& &&&&& The Albums of 2018 That Should Not Go Unnoticed &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Billboard'' &&&&& &&&&& The 20 Best K-pop Albums of 2018: Critics' Picks &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Bravo'' &&&&& &&&&& These are the ten best K-pop albums of the year &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''City Pages'' &&&&& &&&&& Every #1 album from 2018, ranked &&&&& &&&&& 16 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''DIY'' &&&&& &&&&& DIY'S Albums Of the Year 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Rolling Stone India'' &&&&& &&&&& 10 Best K-pop Albums of 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''The Spinnaker'' &&&&& &&&&& Spinnaker's top 10 albums of the year &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Uproxx'' &&&&& &&&&& 20 Must-Hear Pop Albums From 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 16 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Yahoo!'' &&&&& &&&&& The best albums of 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Yardbarker'' &&&&& &&&&& The 10 best pop albums of 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +Awards &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Organization &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Result &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& MBC Plus X Genie Music Awards &&&&& &&&&& Digital Album of the Year &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Korea Popular Music Awards &&&&& &&&&& Best Album &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2019 &&&&& &&&&& Golden Disc Awards &&&&& &&&&& Disk Bonsang &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Disk Daesang &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Gaon Chart Music Awards &&&&& &&&&& Album of the Year – 3rd Quarter &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Korean Music Awards &&&&& &&&&& Album of the Year &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Best Pop Album &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Japan Gold Disc Awards &&&&& &&&&& Best 3 Albums (Asia) &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Gaffa-Prisen Awards &&&&& &&&&& Best International Album &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& &&&&& During the period of July 18 to 24, the first six days of the pre-order period for ''Love Yourself: Answer'', IRIVER reported that the album had sold more than 1.51 million copies, surpassing its predecessor ''Love Yourself: Tear'' as the most pre-ordered album in South Korea.

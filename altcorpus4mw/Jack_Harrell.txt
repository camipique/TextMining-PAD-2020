Jack Harrell &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jack Aaron Harrell''' (born November 23, 1961) is a fiction writer, essayist, and English professor at Brigham Young University–Idaho. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Harrell was raised in the small farming community of Parkersburg, Illinois. After high school, he moved to Vernal, Utah, where he was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He earned his bachelor's degree in English from Brigham Young University (1992), his master's degree in English from Illinois State University (1994), and his PhD in education from the University of Idaho (2006). &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& He served for five years as co-editor for Irreantum, the publication of the Association for Mormon Letters. Harrell has also served as the composition director in the English Department at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where he has taught since 1995. He previously chaired the Creative Writing Committee. &&&&& &&&&& Harrell's writing often addresses the challenges of being a writer and a believer, of juxtaposing aesthetics with the constraints of institutional religion. He said of the writing process, "The interaction a teacher has with other people is always helpful to the writing life. Among other things, a writer has to be an amateur psychologist. Dealing with a variety of people and watching their lives unfold provide all kinds of valuable insights." In his essay, "What Violence in Literature Must Teach us," he added, "Out of the countless and arbitrary experiences of life, the writer selects those that can be ordered into a story, a story with consistent characters, driven by an overarching theme. From the spelling of the words and the grammar of the sentences to the order of the chapters and the working out of a coherent plot, the writer transforms chaos into order. And along comes the reader, hungry to vicariously experience the conflict but also anxious to see if or when the struggle of the story—a struggle that might parallel the conflicts in his or her own life—will come to rest, to conclusion, to order." &&&&& &&&&& Awards and honors &&&&& Harrell's work has received a number of awards in Mormon literary circles. The manuscript version of his novel ''Vernal Promises'', published by Signature Books in 2003, won the Marilyn Brown Novel Award in 2000. In 2010, Signature published his book ''A Sense of Order and Other Stories'', which contains the award-winning stories "Calling and Election" and "A Prophet's Story." His book ''Writing Ourselves: Essays on Creativity, Craft, and Mormonism'' won the AML Award for Criticism. His latest novel, ''Caldera Ridge'', was published in July 2018. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

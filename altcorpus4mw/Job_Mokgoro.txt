He fills the position after former premier Supra Mahumapelo resigned in May, following weeks of violent protests. Mokgoro was reportedly seen as a compromise candidate since the process of selecting a candidate was complicated. &&&&& &&&&& Mokgoro was elected on 22 June 2018. He is expected to serve until the next general elections in 2019. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

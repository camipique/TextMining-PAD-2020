Geoff Duncan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Geoffrey L. Duncan''' (born April 1, 1975) is an American businessman and politician who is the 12th lieutenant governor of Georgia. He is a former member of the Georgia House of Representatives. &&&&& &&&&& After playing college baseball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Duncan played professional baseball for six years until a shoulder injury forced him to retire. He went into business and was elected to the Georgia House in 2012. &&&&& &&&&& Baseball and business career &&&&& Duncan attended Georgia Institute of Technology, and played college baseball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. He played in Minor League Baseball for the Florida Marlins organization from 1996 through 2000, reaching Triple-A, before going into business. &&&&& &&&&& After retiring from baseball, Duncan and his wife, Brooke, started a small marketing company out of their living room. They ultimately grew the company to a full-scale operation in a 10,000 square foot facility and employed over 100 people. The company was eventually sold, and Duncan later became chief executive officer for Wellview Health, a healthcare and wellness company. &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& Duncan was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2012. &&&&& &&&&& Duncan announced he would run for lieutenant governor of Georgia on April 10, 2017. He resigned from the Georgia House in September 2017 to focus on running for lieutenant governor in 2018. Duncan's campaign was centered around his "Policy Over Politics" message and focused on ethics reform and fiscal conservatism. Duncan criticized large tax increases passed by the state legislature, including what is known as the Gas Tax, considered to be the largest tax increase in Georgia. This became a central issue during the campaign, as David Shafer led the conference committee that wrote the Gas Tax (HB 170) and fought for its passage in the Senate. &&&&& &&&&& On May 22, 2018, Shafer received 48.9% of the vote in the Republican primary with Duncan coming in second place with 26.6%. Since no candidate received a majority of votes, the election then went to a runoff held on July 24. The runoff election focused largely on Shafer's record at the capitol and a number of ethical questions surrounding his candidacy. Primarily, Shafer's refusal to release his tax returns, a lawsuit alleging he received nearly $100,000 in free stock from a Georgia company, and a sexual harassment investigation accusing Shafer of "years long" harassment at the capitol. On July 24, Duncan defeated Shafer with 50.16% of the vote. He defeated Democratic nominee Sarah Riggs Amico in the general election, receiving nearly 52% of the vote and avoiding another runoff. &&&&& &&&&& Duncan was inaugurated lieutenant governor on January 14, 2019. He is the second Republican lieutenant governor in the state's history. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Duncan is married to his high school sweetheart, Brooke Duncan. They have three sons and reside in Forsyth County, Georgia. The Duncans are active members of Browns Bridge Community Church in Cumming, Georgia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

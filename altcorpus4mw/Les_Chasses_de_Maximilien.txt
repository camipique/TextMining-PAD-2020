Les Chasses de Maximilien &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''September - Scene from a deer hunt'' &&&&& '''''Les Chasses de Maximilien''''' (''The Hunts of Maximilian'') or '''''Les Belles Chasses de Guise''''' (''The Beautiful Hunts of Guise'') is a set of twelve tapestries, each showing a different hunting scene symbolising a different month of the calendar. All the scenes are set in the Soignes Forest near Brussels and the tapestries were produced by a studio in that city. They were probably commissioned by a member of the House of Habsburg such as Charles V, Margaret of Austria or Mary of Hungary - the latter two both governed the Spanish Netherlands from Brussels. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:16th-century works &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& category:Hunting in art &&&&& category:Belgian art &&&&& &&&&&

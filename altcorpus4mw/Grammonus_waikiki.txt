Grammonus waikiki &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Grammonus waikiki''''', or the '''Waikiki viviparous brotula''', is a species of viviparous brotula found in the Hawaiian Islands where it occurs at depths of around . &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& This species grows to a length of SL. The head and body are brown, while the fins are dark brown. &&&&&  &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& ''Grammonus waikiki'' was originally named ''Microbrotula nigra'' by Terry Gosline in 1953, but was later removed from ''Microbrotula'' by Cohen (1964), who transferred the species to ''Oligopus'', as ''O. niger''. However, this referral made ''nigra'' a secondary homonym of ''Oligopus niger'' Risso, 1827 (a synonym of ''Grammonus ater''), necessitating erection of the replacement name ''Oligopus waikiki''. Later, ''Oligopus'' was shown by Nielsen (1999) to be a junior synonym of ''Pteraclis'', so ''Grammonus'' was resurrected for all bythitids previously assigned to ''Oligopus'', creating the new combination ''Grammonus waikiki''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

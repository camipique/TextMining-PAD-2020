List of unproduced 20th Century Fox Animation projects &&&&& Introduction &&&&& This is a '''list of unmade and unreleased animated projects by 20th Century Fox Animation'''. Some of these films and shows were, or still are, in development limbo. These also include the co-productions the studio collaborated with in the past (i.e. Fox Animation Studios, Blue Sky Studios and Fox Television Animation). &&&&& &&&&& 1990s &&&&& &&&&& ===''Youngblood'' (TV series)=== &&&&& A half-hour ''Youngblood'' animated series was planned for the 1995â€“96 season on Fox as part of an hour block with a proposed ''Cyberforce'' series. The series was being developed by Roustabout Productions, a newly formed animation company. According to Nick Dubois, creative director and co-founder of Roustabout, the series would take a lighthearted approach with tongue-in-cheek humor. A clip was created but the series was never produced. The clip aired in commercials for Youngblood action figures. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Cyberforce'' (TV series)=== &&&&& A ''Cyberforce'' TV series was proposed aside with the ''Youngblood'' TV series but was scrapped alongside it for the same reason. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Betty of the Jungle''=== &&&&& After Fox Animation Studios opened its doors in 1994, animator Bill Kopp (creator of Fox Kids' ''Eek! the Cat'') pitched an idea for an original adult animated film called ''Betty of the Jungle'', in which he describes it as a sexy ''George of the Jungle'' about jungle warrior woman Betty and her smoking gun caring poodle who battle evil to protect their jungle village. However, the project was canceled when Fox spend all their money on ''Anastasia'' and Bill had to work on ''The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show'' for Disney. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Dracula: The Animated Musical''=== &&&&& According to Animation Magazine, Fox had plans to do an animated musical film of the story of Dracula in where the animation of Disney meets the musical style of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' with new songs by Richard Hartley and Richard O'Brien while also paying tribute to 1970's Italian Giallo horror films. However, nothing new came out after and the production was canceled. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Barlowe's Inferno''=== &&&&& In late 90's, Fox had plans to adapted the book ''Barlowe's Inferno'' by Wayne Barlowe into an adult animated film that would follow one man's journey into Hell. However, after Fox Animation Studios closed its doors, the film's production was shut down. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Rhapsody''=== &&&&& An animated film based on the first book in the ''Rhapsody'' trilogy by Elizabeth Haydon of a human girl named Rhapsody going on an epic quest with the warrior Achmed and a Firbolg named Grunthor. However, nothing came through after and the film was likely cancelled. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Santa Calls''=== &&&&& When 20th Century Fox bought Blue Sky Studios, their first feature film with them was originally going to be an animated film based on the children's book ''Santa Calls'' by author William Joyce. It follows Santa Claus asking three gifted children to help him defeat an army of dark elves and save Christmas. However, the film's production was canceled due to difficulties to improve the CGI animation and problems with the production; Blue Sky's first true film was ''Ice Age'' in 2002 and Joyce later worked with Fox and Blue Sky on ''Robots'' and ''Epic''. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Deep Wizardry''=== &&&&& It was rumored that after Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios would release ''Anastasia'' one of their next films was going to be an animated film based on the book ''Deep Wizardry'' by Diane Duane. However, nothing came through and the project was canceled. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Quintaglio Ascension''=== &&&&& One of Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios' next films after ''Anastasia'' was also going to be an animated film based on the ''Quintaglio Ascension'' trilogy by Robert J. Sawyer. But nothing new came and its production was shut down. &&&&& &&&&& ===''The Belgariad''=== &&&&& Another animated film that was going to be made by Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios was an animated film based on ''The Belgariad'' series by David Eddings. However the production for that film was likely canceled after nothing new came through.  &&&&&  &&&&& ===''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''=== &&&&& When 20th Century Fox got the rights to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' series by Douglas Adams, they wanted Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to make an animated film of it. But the film was canceled due to problems at Fox Animation Studios and Touchstone Pictures got the rights to make the movie from Fox which eventually became this film with the same name. &&&&& &&&&& ===''The Little Beauty King''=== &&&&& In the start of the 21st century and end of the 90's, famous comedy writer and director Steve Oedekerk had plans with Fox to do two adult animated films that are ''The Dubbed Action Movie: Enter the Fist'' (a spoof of Japanese Anime with bad English dubs) and ''The Little Beauty King'' (which would have been the first animated comedy film to be a mean dig satire of the Disney Renaissance films and Disney's cliches in their animated films before the DreamWorks Animation movie ''Shrek'' did it). While pictures and storyboards of Little Beauty King were shown online on head animator Uli Meyer's old website and Steve Oedekerk's fan website, the film's production was shut down when not only Fox Animation Studios closed its doors, but Oedekerk was working on the animated movie ''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius'' (that received a nomination for the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and also lost to Shrek) and Oedekerk and Fox had to change and rework ''The Dubbed Action Movie: Enter the Fist'' into a live-action movie that would eventually become the cult comedy ''Kung Pow! Enter the Fist'', a spoof of live-action Hong Kong martial arts films with bad English dubs. &&&&& &&&&& 2000s &&&&& &&&&& ===''Africa''=== &&&&& According to animator Will Makra, Fox had plans to make an adult animated epic film set in Africa.

It was initially planned to be aired in Fox Kids, possibly as early in February 2002. However, Fox Kids ceased its operations in September 2002, and no network wanted to pick up the series, which resulted in the abandonment of this project. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Croc: Legend of the Gobbos'' (TV series)=== &&&&& Due to the success of Fox Interactive's 1997 video game ''Croc: Legend of the Gobbos'' and its 1999 sequel ''Croc 2'', Fox considered creating an animated TV series based on the games, a plan which never came into fruition. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Party Animals''=== &&&&& An adult animated comedy film based on the comedy novel ''Frisco Pigeon Mambo'' by C.D. Payne was going to be produced by the Farrelly Brothers. However, after no news of the film and the poor box-office results of the Farrelly Brothers' first animated film ''Osmosis Jones'' at Warner Bros. Animation, the Farrelly Brothers and Fox decided to pull the plug of the film's production. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Faust''=== &&&&& According to animator Will Makra, Fox also had plans to do an adult animation adaptation of the classic German legend ''Faust''. However, after Fox Animation Studios shut down, its production was shut down. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Around the World in 80 Days''=== &&&&& According to animator Edison Goncalves on his blog, Fox had plans to do an animated film adaption of ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' by Jules Verne but with anthropomorphic animals.

The movie adaptation would be a CGI-animated film created by Blue Sky Studios. Chris Wedge was set to direct the proposed film. However, as of November 2018, the film remains in development hell. &&&&& &&&&& ===''Dr. Seuss' Horton Hatches the Egg''=== &&&&& A film adaptation of the book of the same name by Dr. Seuss and a follow up to the film ''Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!'' was reported to be in production but nothing came of it. Presumably with Dr. Seuss' widow Audrey Geisel moving the film rights of other Dr. Seuss' projects to Illumination either in 2008 or 2009. &&&&& &&&&& 2010s &&&&& &&&&& ===''Anubis''=== &&&&& In 2008, Fox and Blue Sky acquired the film rights to the fantasy novel ''The Anubis Tapestry'' by Bruce Zick for an animated film titled ''Anubis''.

In late March 2018, it was announced that FXX would not move forward with the series due to creative differences. Stephen Glover later admitted that the "creative difference" in question involved an episode revolving around Taylor Swift which FXX stated was the "last straw" and that they wanted to give ''Rick and Morty'' "a run for its money". &&&&& &&&&& ===''The Dam Keeper''=== &&&&& ''The Dam Keeper'' feature had been in development at Fox Animation since 2016, but with the impending sale of Fox to Disney, Kondo and Tsutsumi have decided to bring the project back into Tonko House's hands.

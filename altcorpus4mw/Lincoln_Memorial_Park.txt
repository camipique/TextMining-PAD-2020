Lincoln Memorial Park &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery''' is a historic African-American cemetery in the Brownsville neighborhood of Miami, Florida. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery was first used as a graveyard in 1924 on land owned by a F.B. Miller (a white realtor). In 1937 the burial ground was purchased by Kelsey Pharr, who was a black funeral director.

After his death in 1964, the cemetery passed on to his goddaughter Elyn Johson, and then to Jessica Williams, the latter's niece. &&&&& &&&&& The layout of the cemetery is of the above the ground burial style which is very popular in locations at or below sea level and are prone to flooding, just like Evergreen Memorial Park a few blocks away and the Charlotte Jane Memorial Park Cemetery in Coconut Grove. . &&&&& &&&&& Some of Miami's most noted African-Americans are buried in Lincoln Memorial Park: &&&&& &&&&& * Kelsey Phar, first owner of the cemetery; (died 1964) &&&&& * H.E.S.

Icelandic Coast Guard Aeronautical Division &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Icelandic Coast Guard Aeronautical Division''' is the air wing of the Icelandic Coast Guard. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Coast Guard's Aeronautical Division was founded on 10 December 1955 when a Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina flying boat was acquired. It was originally from the Iceland Defense Force but was damaged near Langanes in 1954. It was registered as TF-RAN and nicknamed Rán. &&&&& &&&&& Currently the Icelandic Coast Guard operates three Aerospatiale AS-332L1 Super Puma helicopters, which are registered as TF-LIF, TF-SYN and TF-GNA. As a response to the withdrawal of the Iceland Defense Force at the year 2006 the Coast Guard operated four helicopters, including leased Aérospatiale SA-365N-1 Dauphin 2 TF-EIR, but this number has since been reduced to the three Super Pumas as of 2015. &&&&& &&&&& The Coast Guard also operates a single Bombardier DHC-8-Q314, registered as TF-SIF, modified for maritime surveillance and reconnaissance. This plane has been extensively modified by FIELD to carry a modern Mission Management System and suite of surveillance sensors, air operable door and communications/navigation equipment. It is occasionally also used for surveillance of volcanic eruptions, e.g. of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010. &&&&& &&&&& Unlike the fleet, aircraft of the Icelandic Coast Guard have standard Icelandic civilian registers, as the Althing (parliament) has never agreed on laws for military or government aircraft. Over the time since the division was formed the regulations for standard civilian aircraft have become more restrictive. As a result, the Coast Guard can no longer operate military aircraft like it did in the past. Nevertheless, current helicopters are outfitted with latest generation U.S. night vision equipment, reserved for U.S. armed forces and the armies of their allies and thus the only civilian registered aircraft in the world, so equipped. &&&&& &&&&& Air defence is Responsibility of the U.S. armed forces and the force responsible is called the Iceland Defense Force &&&&& &&&&& Inventory &&&&& &&&&& === Currently operated aircraft/helicopters === &&&&& &&&&& * TF-SIF is a Bombardier DHC-8-Q314 named after Sif, goddess and wife of Thor, the god of thunder and trollslaying.

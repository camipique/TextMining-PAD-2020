Jimmy O'Brien (rugby union) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jimmy O'Brien''' (born 27 November 1996) is an Irish rugby union player who plays sevens for the Ireland national rugby sevens team and fifteens with the Leinster Rugby academy. &&&&& &&&&& With the Irish sevens team he generally plays at centre, but can also fill in at fly-half. O'Brien played for Ireland at the 2018 Hong Kong Sevens qualifier, scoring four tries, but Ireland lost to Japan 7â€“12 in the semifinal and consequently failed to qualify as a core team for the 2018-19 World Series. O'Brien played for Ireland on the London and Paris legs of the 2017-18 World Rugby Sevens Series; in those tournaments, despite its non-core status, Ireland surprised by finishing third and seventh respectively, with O'Brien scoring four tries across the two tournaments. &&&&& &&&&& O'Brien was born in Eadestown in County Kildare, Ireland. He played in his school rugby with Newbridge College. Although he played fly-half at school, he has moved to inside centre with the Leinster academy. His strengths in attack include a good kicking game, footwork, and passing, while in defence despite his lack of size he has a physical approach.  &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

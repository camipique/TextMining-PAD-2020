126	Latins_(Middle_Ages)
Latins (Middle Ages) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The name '''Latin''' was in the Middle Ages a common demonym among the followers of the Latin Church of Western Christianity. It derived from the Italic tribe who in antiquity developed ancient Roman civilization. The name was used irrespective of ethnicity, including by Germanic, Italic and Slavic peoples. In the Byzantine Empire, and the broader Greek Orthodox world, Latins was an exonym for all people who followed Roman Catholic Christianity. It was generally a negative characterization, especially after the 1054 schism. Thus the people associated with the states created during the Crusades were generally referred to as Latins or Franks. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Greek East and Latin West &&&&& * Latin Church in the Middle East &&&&& * Latin Empire &&&&& * Latinokratia &&&&& * Westerner &&&&& * Barbarian &&&&& * Vlachs &&&&& * Walhaz &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

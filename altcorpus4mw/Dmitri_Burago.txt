Dmitri Burago &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Dmitri Yurievich Burago''' (Дмитрий Юрьевич Бураго, born 1964) is a Russian mathematician, specializing in geometry. &&&&& &&&&& He is the son of the professor of mathematics in Leningrad Yuri Dmitrievich Burago, with whom he also published a book. Burago received his doctorate in 1994 at Saint Petersburg State University under the supervision of Anatoly Vershik. He was at the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg and is now a professor at Pennsylvania State University's Center for Dynamical Systems and Geometry. &&&&& &&&&& In 1992 he was awarded the prize of the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. In 2014 he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize with Yuri Burago and Sergei Vladimirovich Ivanov for their book ''A course in metric geometry''. &&&&& &&&&& Selected publications &&&&& ==Articles== &&&&& * "Periodic metrics."

In vivo supersaturation &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''In vivo supersaturation''' is a term denoting the behavior of orally administered compounds that undergo supersaturation as they pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Typically these compounds have a weakly basic nature (p''K''a in the range of 5 to 8) and a relatively low solubility in aqueous solutions. In vivo supersaturation is a recent phenomenon that was first observed by Yamashita et al in 2003. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

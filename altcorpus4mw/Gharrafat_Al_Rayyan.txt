Gharrafat Al Rayyan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& View of Qatar National Convention Centre in Gharrafat Al Rayyan. &&&&& &&&&& '''Gharrafat Al Rayyan''' () is a district of Al Rayyan City in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al Rayyan. &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& "Gharrafat" is derived from the Arabic word meaning "to scoop up". This name was earned due to the area's low elevation, allowing it to act as a floodplain from whence locals would collect water in the past. The second part of its name originates from the city of Al Rayyan, which translates to "irrigation"; it was given this name because it constitutes a part of the city. &&&&& &&&&& Infrastructure &&&&& The district houses the Qatar Science & Technology Park, the Qatar National Convention Centre, Education City community housing and other facilities of Qatar Foundation. North-east of the district is Al Gharrafa, which hosts the Sidra Medical and Research Center.

Gail Honeyman &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Gail Honeyman''' (born 1972) is a Scottish writer, whose debut novel, ''Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine'', won the 2017 Costa First Novel Award. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Born and raised in Stirling in central Scotland to a mother who worked as a civil servant and a father in science, Honeyman was a voracious reader in her childhood, visiting the library "a ridiculous number of times a week." &&&&& &&&&& She studied French language and literature at Glasgow University, before continuing her education at the University of Oxford for a postgraduate course in French poetry. However, she decided that an academic career was not for her and started a string of "backroom jobs", first as a civil servant in economic development and then as an administrator at Glasgow University. &&&&& &&&&& While working as an administrator, Honeyman enrolled in a Faber Academy writing course, submitting the first three chapters of what would become ''Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine'' to a competition for unpublished fiction by female writers, run by Cambridge's Lucy Cavendish College. The book went on to earn numerous awards and wide critical acclaim. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& ''Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine'' won the 2017 Costa First Novel Award, and since then Honeyman has been interviewed often, including by ''The Guardian'', ''The Telegraph'' and Waterstones. Of her relationship with the book's titular character she told ''The Telegraph'': "Eleanor Oliphant isn't me, or anyone I know but of course I've felt loneliness â€“ everybody does". &&&&& In January 2018, Honeyman said she was working on a new novel, "set in a different period and location." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

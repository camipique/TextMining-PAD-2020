Known for a passionate, if not fiery, personality, he joined the battles for independence against the Austrians during the revolutions of 1848. When Austrian rule was reimposed, he was forced to flee to Switzerland. By 1852, he had traveled to Argentina, though he continued to travel and return to Italy. In 1857, he settled in Buenos Aires, where he found increasing commissions and became a master for painters like José María Gutiérrez (painter). By the 1860s, a public controversy raged about whether Manzoni or Baldassare Verazzi was the better artist. His painting of ''El Asado'', won a gold prize at the First National Exposition in Cordoba, Argentina (1871). &&&&& &&&&& ''Gaucho teaching a foreigner his style of carving a roast pork'' (''El Asado''). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& *The entry also derives information from the entry in Spanish for the artist. &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

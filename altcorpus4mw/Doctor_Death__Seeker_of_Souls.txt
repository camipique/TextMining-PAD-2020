It's campy and spends much of its running time with tongue placed firmly in cheek but Considine's performance is great and as predictable as the whole thing might be, it's ridiculously entertaining." Andrew Pragasam from ''The Spinning Image'' awarded the film 4/10 stars, calling it "trashy nonsense". TV Guide gave the film 1/5 stars, writing "Overall, this is a pretty bad effort, but camp fans may get some satisfaction from the cameo appearances by former Stooge Moe Howard and TV horror host Larry "Seymour" Vincent." &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

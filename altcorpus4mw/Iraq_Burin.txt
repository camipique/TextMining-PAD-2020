Of this, 1,797 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 8,741 used for cereals, while 106 dunams were built-up land. &&&&& &&&&& ===Jordanian era=== &&&&& In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Iraq Burin came under Jordanian rule. &&&&& &&&&& ===Post-1967=== &&&&& Demonstration in Iraq Burin &&&&& After the Six-Day War in 1967, Iraq Burin has been under Israeli occupation. &&&&& &&&&& In 2009, the Israeli settlement of Har Brakha took control of 30 dunams of village land, west of the village, which formerly were used for grapes and almonds. In total, Israel has confiscated 291 dunams of land from Iraq Burin in order to construct Har Brakha, in addition to land taken from Burin and Kafr Qallil. &&&&&  &&&&& In March, 2010, two brothers of the village, ''Mohammed'' and ''Osaid Qadus'', 16 and 18 years old, were shot dead by Israeli soldiers, in an incident which the IDF said happened because the Israeli troops were "ill-prepared for missions." &&&&& &&&&& In January, 2011, 19 year old ''Oday Maher Hamza Qadous'' was shot dead by an Israeli settler from Har Brakha. The villagers said Qadous was farming in the village fields when he was shot, while the settlers said he was throwing stones. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& *  &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& *  &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& *  &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& == External links ==  &&&&& * Welcome To 'Iraq Burin &&&&& * Iraq Burin &&&&& *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 11:   IAA, Wikimedia commons &&&&& * 'Iraq Burin areal photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, ARIJ &&&&& * Development Priorities and Needs in Iraq Burin, ARIJ &&&&& * Destroying Scores of Trees in Iraq Burin, POICA &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

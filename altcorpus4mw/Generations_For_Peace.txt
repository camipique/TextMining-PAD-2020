Generations For Peace &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Generations For Peace''' (GFP) is a Jordanian non-governmental organisation based in Amman dedicated to peacebuilding through sustainable conflict transformation at the grassroots. Founded in 2007 by HRH Prince Feisal Al Hussein, GFP has worked with and empowered volunteer leaders of youth in 50 countries around the world to promote active tolerance and responsible citizenship in communities experiencing various forms of conflict and violence. The organisation is the leading Jordanian NGO, with a global ranking of #3 in peacebuilding and #29 overall by NGO Advisor's 2018 Top 500 NGOs in the World. As one of only two peace-through-sports organisations to be officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee, it uses carefully facilitated sport-based games, art, advocacy, dialogue, and empowerment activities to serve as an entry point for engaging children, youth, and adults, and to promote integrated education and sustained behavioural change. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& Generations For Peace was founded as a peace-through-sports initiative of the Jordan Olympic Committee in 2007, but has since expanded to include art, advocacy, dialogue, and empowerment as tools to bring peace to communities facing division and conflict. Since its founding, the organisation has trained almost 12,000 volunteers and reached 600,000 children, youth, and adults across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East as of 2019. It has also been supported by a variety of partners, including the European Union, UNICEF, USAID, UNESCO, International Olympic Committee, Samsung, and the University of Oxford. &&&&& &&&&& Generations For Peace established a research institute, the Generations For Peace Institute, in 2010.In 2018, the organisation was ranked the best in Jordan and thirtieth in the world on a list of the "top 500 NGOs in the world" published by NGO Advisor in Geneva; additionally, it was placed second in the "peacebuilding" category. &&&&& &&&&& Model &&&&& Generations For Peace uses a volunteer cascading model in which trained volunteers in turn train future volunteers in their home communities, ensuring that programmes and ideas are spread while remaining true to their original design. &&&&& &&&&& Tools for Peacebuilding &&&&& Generations For Peace has trained youth volunteers in regions affected by conflict across 50 countries around the globe, empowering them to build lasting peace in their communities. To further this peacebuilding mission, GFP has developed and now implements five tools to bring about and promote peace in local settings.'''Sport For Peace''' uses sports-based games and activities that integrate peer-group and peacebuilding education, aiming to promote a sense of understanding and unity that transcends the divides found in typical day-to-day life in high-conflict communities.Generations For Peace#cite%20note-7|7 The impact of sport in peacebuilding initiatives is recognized by the UN through its United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace (UNOSDP).Generations For Peace#cite%20note-8|8 '''Arts For Peace''' is effective both for psycho-social healing after violence and trauma, and for building trust, developing respect, and ensuring inclusion across previously divided social groups.Generations For Peace#cite%20note-9|9 '''Advocacy For Peace''' uses print, social, and broadcast media, as well as rallies, marches, demonstrations, and special community events to build support and advocacy amongst different groups for change in local community, starting at the grassroots. '''Dialogue For Peace''' creates a safe space in which participants can engage in an honest exchange of ideas, all while remaining neutral, non-directive, and non-prescriptive. '''Empowerment For Peace''' creates activities that build the life skills and capacities of youth and adults who are trapped in conflict due to lack of power, influence, economic status, or specific vulnerabilities. &&&&& &&&&& Locations &&&&& &&&&& === Satellite Offices === &&&&& &&&&& * Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina &&&&& * Kaduna, Nigeria &&&&& * Garoowe and Mogadishu, Somalia &&&&& * Juba, South Sudan &&&&& * Khartoum, Sudan &&&&& &&&&& === Countries with GFP Programmes === &&&&& All countries with currently active GFP Programmes as of 2019 are highlighted in bold. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Afghanistan &&&&& &&&&& Algeria &&&&& &&&&& Armenia &&&&& &&&&& Azerbaijan &&&&& &&&&& Bangladesh &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Belarus &&&&& &&&&& Bosnia and Herzegovina &&&&& &&&&& Burundi &&&&& &&&&& Côte d'Ivoire &&&&& &&&&& Cyprus &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Egypt &&&&& &&&&& Gambia &&&&& &&&&& '''Georgia''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Ghana''' &&&&& &&&&& India &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Indonesia''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Iraq''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Jordan''' &&&&& &&&&& Kenya &&&&& &&&&& Kosovo &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Kyrgyzstan''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Lebanon''' &&&&& &&&&& Lesotho &&&&& &&&&& Liberia &&&&& &&&&& Libya &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Madagascar &&&&& &&&&& '''Nepal''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Nigeria''' &&&&& &&&&& '''North Macedonia, Republic of''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Pakistan''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Palestine''' &&&&& &&&&& Russian Federation &&&&& &&&&& '''Rwanda''' &&&&& &&&&& Senegal &&&&& &&&&& Serbia &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Sierra Leone''' &&&&& &&&&& Somalia &&&&& &&&&& '''South Sudan''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Sri Lanka''' &&&&& &&&&& '''Sudan''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Tajikistan &&&&& &&&&& Timor-Leste &&&&& &&&&& Togo &&&&& &&&&& '''Tunisia''' &&&&& &&&&& Turkmenistan &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Uganda''' &&&&& &&&&& Ukraine &&&&& &&&&& '''Yemen''' &&&&& &&&&& Zambia &&&&& &&&&& '''Zimbabwe  ''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2019 Rankings &&&&& Generations For Peace was earned the following rankings for 2019 by NGO Advisor. &&&&& &&&&& * Anti-Violence: '''#2''' in the World &&&&& * Human Rights: '''#2''' in the World &&&&& * Peacebuilding: '''#3''' in the World &&&&& * Capacity-Building: '''#4''' in the World &&&&& * Inclusion: '''#6''' in the World &&&&& * Knowledge Sharing: '''#6''' in the World &&&&& * Gender: '''#7''' in the World &&&&& * Social Justice: '''#7''' in the World &&&&& * Community Building: '''#8''' in the World &&&&& * Education: '''#9''' in the World &&&&& * Children & Youth: '''#11''' in the World &&&&& * Overall: '''#30''' in the World &&&&& &&&&& Research Partners &&&&& &&&&& * Uppsala University &&&&& * Georgetown University &&&&& * University of the Western Cape &&&&& * Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation &&&&& * University of Oxford &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

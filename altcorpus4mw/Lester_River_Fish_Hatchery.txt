Lester River Fish Hatchery &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Lester River Fish Hatchery''' was a federal fish hatchery in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. It was built at the mouth of the Lester River in the 1880s to propagate fish for the Lake Superior commercial fishery. The hatchery closed in 1946 and the facility was sold to the University of Minnesota Duluth, which used it as its '''Limnological Research Station'''. The surviving four buildings are noted for their Stick and Shingle Style architecture, forming a distinctive landmark to local residents as well as tourists heading to Superior's North Shore. &&&&& &&&&& In 1978 the hatchery complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name '''US Fisheries Station, Duluth''', for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated for exemplifying the Stick and Shingle styles popular in Minnesota during the 1880s and for its long association with studies conducted on Lake Superior. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& File:Lester River Fish Hatchery cottage.jpg|The cottage &&&&& File:Outbuilding at U.S. Fisheries Station, Duluth, 2012.jpg|The carriage barn &&&&& File:U.S. Fisheries Station, Duluth, 2014 (1).jpg|The rear of the laboratory &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * National Register of Historic Places listings in St. Louis County, Minnesota &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

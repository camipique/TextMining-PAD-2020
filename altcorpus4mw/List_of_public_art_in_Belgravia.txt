List of public art in Belgravia &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& This is a '''list of public art in Belgravia''', a district in the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London. The area is mainly composed of early 19th-century residential buildings, many of which now serve diplomatic uses. Several of the figures commemorated by memorials here were influential in the early development of Belgravia under the ownership of the Grosvenor family (later the Dukes of Westminster). Belgrave Square, which gives the locale its name, has a particularly high number of embassies; its public sculptures are therefore of a pronounced international character. &&&&& &&&&& City of Westminster &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

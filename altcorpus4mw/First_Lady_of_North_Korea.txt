The position was left vacant under the leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong-il, who had two wives and three domestic partners at different times; although the position was re-established following the successful April 2018 inter-Korean summit. &&&&& &&&&& The current First Lady is Ri Sol-ju, wife of Chairman Kim Jong-un, in office since 15 April 2018. In April 2018, Ri's title was elevated to "respected First Lady", the first time since 1974 the title had been used in North Korea, when it was used about Kim Song-ae. Ri was previously called by state media "comrade"; the promotion occurred ahead of the April 2018 inter-Korean summit where Sol-ju and the First Lady of South Korea, Kim Jung-sook, were in attendance. &&&&& &&&&& List of First Ladies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea &&&&& The following is a list of the First Ladies of North Korea. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& No. &&&&& &&&&& Portrait &&&&& &&&&& First Lady &&&&& &&&&& Tenure &&&&& &&&&& Age at tenure start &&&&& &&&&& Supreme Leader &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Kim Song-ae''' &&&&& &&&&& December 17, 1963–August 15, 1974 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Kim Il-sung &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Vacant''''' &&&&& &&&&& August 15, 1974–April 15, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Kim Jong-il &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&& Portrait painting of Ri Sol-ju &&&&& &&&&& '''Ri Sol-ju''' &&&&& &&&&& April 15, 2018–present &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Kim Jong-un &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *First Lady &&&&& *Supreme Leader of North Korea &&&&& *List of leaders of North Korea &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

East Greta Coal Mining Co. 10 Class Steam Locomotives &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''East Greta Coal Mining Co. 10 Class Steam Locomotives''' is a set of heritage-listed Class 10 (2-8-2) steam locomotives built for the East Greta Coal Mining Co. and the South Maitland Railways in New South Wales, Australia. They were built from 1911 to 1927 by Beyer, Peacock and Company, Manchester, England. It is also known as South Maitland Railway Steam Locomotives. They are variously owned by the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum, Hunter Valley Training Company Pty Ltd, Port Waratah Coal Services and Richmond Main Museum (Private). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The locomotives were built between 1911 and 1927. They were specifically designed by the East Greta Coal Mining Co to perform certain tasks on their private railway system located in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. During the period between 1911 and 1927 the East Greta Coal Mining Co and then the South Maitland Railways, who bought out the total of 14 identical locomotives from the most famous locomotive construction company in the world at that time, Bayer Peacock, Gorton foundry, Manchester, England. They were the most powerful tank steam locomotive to be used in Australia. They had a wheel arrangement of 2-8-2 and were a saturated steam locomotive. They had a copper fire box and were coal fired. They were used exclusively on the private railway system in the Hunter Valley owned by the East Greta Coal Mining Co to haul coal, goods and passengers from 1911 to 1983 when steam ceased operations. They were then transferred to the parent company, Coal & Allied's private line on the Richmond Vale Railway System which was constructed in 1853 and ceased steam operations in 1987. These locomotives are recognised worldwide and they are the only complete class of steam locomotive in the world to survive intact today. &&&&& &&&&& ===History of the Class 10 locomotives after they came out of operations=== &&&&& &&&&& * 10 June 1983: Commercial steam operations cease on South Maitland Railways Pty. Ltd. (a division of Coal and Allied Industries). Locomotives (ex No.19) retained for further service on Richmond Vale Railway. &&&&& * Sept. 1983: No.19 donated to Port Waratah Coal Services, and placed on static display at Port Waratah. Deteriorates rapidly in marine environment. &&&&& * 22 Sept. 1987: Commercial steam operations cease on Richmond Vale Railway (also a division of C&A;).Locomotive Nos.22,24,25, and 30 placed in storage at Hexham, and Nos. 10, 17, 18, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28, and 31 put in storage at East Greta Junction. &&&&& * 1989: Nos. 22, 24, 25, and 30 given to and transferred from Hexham to Richmond Main Railway Museum. Nos.10 and 18 given to Hunter Valley Training Company to be held in trust, on the understanding that they were not to be sold, and that they reside permanently at East Greta Junction. &&&&& * Nos. 17, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28, and 31 transferred to Hunter Valley Training Company as part of its purchase of the land and buildings comprising the South Maitland Railway locomotive complex. Hunter Valley Training Company to use these locomotives as it saw fit for apprentice training purposes, and in the event of their sale, the proceeds to be divided equally between South Maitland Railway and Hunter Valley Training Company. &&&&& * Early 1990: News emerges that Nos. 17, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28,and 31 have been sold to Chris Richards for $160,000. Hunter Valley Training Company removes engines from their shed and stores them in open, pending their removal by Chris Richards who at that stage has no place to store them. &&&&& * 11.12.92: After standing 3 years in the open at East Greta Junction (but reasonably well protected from the elements), Nos. 17 and 20 are transferred dead by rail from East Greta Junction to Rothbury colliery, which had been acquired by Chris Richards in the interim. They are soon followed by the remaining 5 engines which are transported by road. &&&&& * 1995: No.19 moved from Port Waratah to Kooragang Island for cosmetic restoration using trainees funded by the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Training. Placed on display at location which was out of bounds to the public. &&&&& * 12 May 2009: No. 19 moved from Kooragang to Richmond Main Railway Museum to join Nos. 22, 24, 25, and 30. (National Trust of Australia (NSW)NSW 2013) &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The Class 10 Steam Locomotives numbers include 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30 and 31. Class of 14 2-8-2 steam tank locomotives built for the South Maitland Railway. &&&&& &&&&& There were fourteen Class 10 (2-8-2) steam locomotives built for the East Greta Coal Mining Co. and the South Maitland Railways and their numbers were 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30 and 31. Their physical condition ranges from excellent to poor. The locomotives were designed and built by Beyer Peacock and Co. of Manchester, England between 1911 and 1925. The recommended management is that locomotives should be thoroughly stripped, rust removed, repainted and placed in dry, undercover storage. &&&&& &&&&& === Ownership as at 2012 === &&&&& &&&&& Locomotive No - Builder's No - Service commenced/ended &&&&& &&&&& ====Hunter Valley Railway Trust - Rothbury Colliery==== &&&&& &&&&& * Locomotive No. 17 - Builder's Number 5790 1914 - December 1983 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 20 - Builder's Number 5998 1920 - February 1985 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 23 - Builder's Number 6056 1921 - August 1982 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 26 - Builder's Number 6127 1923 - July 1983 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 27 - Builder's Number 6137 1923 - March 1987 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 28 - Builder's Number 6138 1923 - December 1983 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 31 - Builder's Number 5295 1926 - June 1984 &&&&& &&&&& ====Richmond Vale Railway Museum==== &&&&& &&&&& * Locomotive No. 19 - Builder's Number 5910 1915 - November 1982 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 22 - Builder's Number 6055 1921 - September 1987 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 24 - Builder's Number 6125 1922 - September 1987 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 25 - Builder's Number 6126 1923 - September 1987 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 30 - Builder's Number 6294 1926 - September 1987 &&&&& &&&&& ====Hunter Valley Training Company - East Greta Junction==== &&&&& &&&&& * Locomotive No. 10 - Builder's Number 5520 1912 - January 1987 &&&&& * Locomotive No. 18 - Builder's Number 5909 1915 - December 1984 &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& The locomotives were the last commercial steam operation in Australia and there were only 14 locomotives ever built which still survive today, making them the only steam locomotive class in the world to survive in its entirety. The design of the fourteen locomotives is technologically significant and there are no other identical locomotives of this design in the world. The locomotives formed the backbone of communications and transport in an isolated coal mining region of NSW. The locomotives are internationally rare and a good representative example of this type of coalfields steam locomotive. They are generally complete but some are in poor condition. &&&&& &&&&& 10 Class Steam Locomotives was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. &&&&& &&&&& '''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' &&&&& &&&&& The locomotives were the last commercial steam operation in Australia and there were 14 locomotives only ever built which still survive today making them the only steam locomotive class in the world to survive in its entirety. &&&&& &&&&& '''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.''' &&&&& &&&&& There were only 14 ever built to this design and are technologically significant.

In 1826 Denis Davydov bought it in the name of his wife, and lived there until 1830. According to the confessions, in this house lived Major-General Dionysius Vasilyevich Davydov, his wife Sofya Nikolaevna and the children Vasily, Nikolai, Dionysius and Achilles. Presumably, in this house of Denis Davydov A. Pushkin visited. In 1830 the Davydovs moved out of this house, and in 1833 they sold it. In 1835 the Davydovs purchased a palace house on Prechistenka, 17. &&&&& &&&&& The two-story mansion was practically not reconstructed from the beginning of the XIX century. The central part of it ends with a small mezzanine with a low triangular pediment. The side parts at the level of the first floor were originally trimmed by a rust. Three windows of the second floor are decorated with sandrikami. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

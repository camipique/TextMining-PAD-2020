Dragon Ball Super: Broly &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& is a 2018 Japanese anime adventure, fantasy, martial arts film directed by Tatsuya Nagamine and written by ''Dragon Ball'' series creator Akira Toriyama. It is the twentieth ''Dragon Ball'' feature film overall, the third film produced with Toriyama's direct involvement, and the first to carry the ''Dragon Ball Super'' branding. &&&&& &&&&& Set after the events of the Universe Survival Saga depicted in ''Dragon Ball Super'', the film follows series protagonists Goku and Vegeta as they encounter a powerful Saiyan named Broly. In the beginning, it tells the history of the Saiyans and the background story of these three Saiyans with different destinies connected to the turbulent period of their race, and later resulting in a massive fight between them. &&&&& &&&&& The film represents the first appearance of Broly in the primary ''Dragon Ball'' series continuity, following the character's appearances in the films ''Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan'' (1993), ''Broly – Second Coming'' (1994), and ''Bio-Broly'' (1994). ''Dragon Ball Super: Broly'' is the highest-grossing ''Dragon Ball'' film ever, and one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Forty-one years ago, the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta is ruled the forces of King Cold, who delegates their command to his son Frieza. King Vegeta, leader of the Saiyans, believes his son Prince Vegeta is a prodigy destined to liberate their people and rule the universe. He learns of Broly, a Saiyan baby born with an abnormal power level exceeding that of his son, and exiles Broly to the distant planet Vampa. &&&&& &&&&& Broly and his father Paragus, who goes after his son, are stranded on Vampa after their ships are damaged. Paragus vows to raise Broly as a mighty warrior to exact revenge on King Vegeta. Five years later, a low-class Saiyan warrior named Bardock becomes suspicious of Frieza and sends his son Kakarot (later named Goku) to Earth. His suspicions are confirmed when Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta after learning of a legend about a Legendary Super Saiyan who could one day defeat him. The Saiyan race is eradicated, except for Broly and Paragus, Goku and his brother Raditz, Vegeta and his comrade Nappa and Vegeta's brother Tarble. &&&&& &&&&& In the present day, Goku and Vegeta train on an island with Bulma, Bulla, Beerus and Whis. Bulma is contacted by Trunks, who informs her that six of the Dragon Balls have been stolen by Frieza's soldiers. Goku, Vegeta, Bulma and Whis travel to the Arctic to find the seventh Dragon Ball before Frieza can retrieve it. Meanwhile, Broly and Paragus are rescued from Vampa by Cheelai and Lemo, two low-class soldiers in Frieza's army searching for recruits. They are brought to Frieza, who recruits them to help him defeat Goku and Vegeta. The two groups come face-to-face in the Arctic, where Paragus orders Broly to attack Vegeta. &&&&& &&&&& Broly fights Vegeta and then Goku, growing stronger as the fight goes on and catching up to their Super Saiyan God forms. Goku overpowers Broly with Super Saiyan Blue and Frieza responds by murdering Paragus, triggering the awakening of Broly's Super Saiyan powers. He overwhelms Goku and Vegeta with his new power, so they trick him into attacking Frieza instead and then teleport to Piccolo's location. Goku and Piccolo teach Vegeta how to use the Fusion Dance technique; about an hour later, after two failed attempts, Goku and Vegeta successfully fuse together into Gogeta and teleport back to the battlefield. Gogeta turns Super Saiyan and engages in a beam clash with Broly, which shatters the fabric of reality and sends the two into another dimension. Gogeta dominates the fight until an infuriated Broly powers up even further into his Legendary Super Saiyan form. This allows Broly to regain the advantage, until Gogeta powers up into Super Saiyan Blue, allowing him to dominate the fight once again. The two then clash even more violently, breaking through multiple dimensions, before arriving back in the real world. &&&&& &&&&& Gogeta defeats Broly and is about to obliterate him with a powerful energy wave, but Cheelai and Lemo, who had formed a friendship with Broly, summon Shenron with the Dragon Balls and use their wish to transport Broly back to Vampa. Frieza retreats, promising to return another time. Goku later meets with Broly, Cheelai, and Lemo on Vampa, wishing to be friends and providing them with various survival supplies from Capsule Corp, while also hoping to spar with Broly again. &&&&& &&&&& Voice Cast &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Character name &&&&& &&&&& Japanese &&&&& &&&&& English &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Goku''' &&&&& &&&&& Masako Nozawa &&&&& &&&&& Sean SchemmelColleen Clinkenbeard (Young) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Vegeta''' &&&&& &&&&& Ryō Horikawa &&&&& &&&&& Christopher Sabat &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Frieza''' &&&&& &&&&& Ryūsei Nakao &&&&& &&&&& Christopher Ayres &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Paragus''' &&&&& &&&&& Katsuhisa Hōki &&&&& &&&&& Dameon Clarke &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bulma''' &&&&& &&&&& Aya Hisakawa &&&&& &&&&& Monica Rial &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Cheelai''' &&&&& &&&&& Nana Mizuki &&&&& &&&&& Erica Lindbeck &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Broly''' &&&&& &&&&& Bin ShimadaYoshika Morishita (Young) &&&&& &&&&& Vic MignognaBrina Palencia (Young) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lemo''' &&&&& &&&&& Tomokazu Sugita &&&&& &&&&& Bruce Carey &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Whis''' &&&&& &&&&& Masakazu Morita &&&&& &&&&& Ian Sinclair &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Piccolo''' &&&&& &&&&& Toshio Furukawa &&&&& &&&&& Christopher Sabat &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Beerus''' &&&&& &&&&& Kōichi Yamadera &&&&& &&&&& Jason Douglas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Kikono''' &&&&& &&&&& Masami Kikuchi &&&&& &&&&& Sonny Franks &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Berryblue''' &&&&& &&&&& Kimiko Saitō &&&&& &&&&& Veronica Taylor &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Bardock''' &&&&& &&&&& Masako Nozawa &&&&& &&&&& Sonny Strait &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Beets''' &&&&& &&&&& Takuya Kirimoto &&&&& &&&&& Anthony Bowling &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''King Vegeta''' &&&&& &&&&& Banjō Ginga &&&&& &&&&& Christopher Sabat &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Gine''' &&&&& &&&&& Naoko Watanabe &&&&& &&&&& Emily Neves &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Leek''' &&&&& &&&&& Yohei Azakami &&&&& &&&&& Austin Tindle &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''King Cold''' &&&&& &&&&& Ryūzaburō Ōtomo &&&&& &&&&& Jason Douglas &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Moroko''' &&&&& &&&&& Hisao Egawa &&&&& &&&&& Daman Mills &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Daigen''' &&&&& &&&&& TBA &&&&& &&&&& Ray Hurd &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Raditz''' &&&&& &&&&& Shigeru Chiba &&&&& &&&&& Justin Cook &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Nappa''' &&&&& &&&&& Tetsu Inada &&&&& &&&&& Phil Parsons &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Taro''' &&&&& &&&&& Masaya Takatsuka &&&&& &&&&& Marcus D.

Ollie Barder writing for ''Forbes'', stated that the "only real criticism at this point is that after this solid narrative starting setup, we have a pretty hefty time jump to where we are post-''Dragon Ball Super''. Considering the depth and breadth of the story between these points of time, it would have been nice to have a bit more exposition to help with the pacing. However, that said, this is already a long movie and we all know that we have a massive fight to look forward to". Allegra Frank of ''Polygon'' concluded that the movie "gets the fundamentals of ''Dragon Ball'' extremely right, no matter where you're coming in from", with "no grand statements to be made in ''Dragon Ball Super: Broly'', and more amusement than anxiety". &&&&& &&&&& Accolades &&&&& The film was nominated for the Animation of the Year at 42nd Japan Academy Prize. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

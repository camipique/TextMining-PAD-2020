205	Explorer_41
Explorer 41 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Explorer 41''', also called as '''IMP-G''' and '''IMP 5''', was a U.S. satellite launched as part of Explorers program. Explorer 41 as launched on June 21, 1969 on Vandenberg AFB, California, United States, with a Delta rocket. Explorer 41 was the fifth satellite of the '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform'''. &&&&& &&&&& Spacecraft and mission &&&&& Explorer 41 was a spin-stabilized satellite placed into a high-inclination, highly elliptical orbit to measure energetic particles, magnetic fields, and plasma in cislunar space. The line of apsides and the satellite spin vector were within a few degrees of being parallel and normal, respectively, to the ecliptic plane. Initial local time of apogee was about 1,300 hours. Initial satellite spin rate was 27.5 rpm. &&&&& &&&&& The basic telemetry sequence was 20.48 seconds. Data transmission was nearly 100% for the spacecraft life except for the interval from November 15, 1971, to February 1, 1972, when data acquisition was limited to the vicinity of the magnetotail neutral sheet. &&&&& &&&&& It recorded important data on one of the most potent solar proton events of the Space Age in early August 1972. &&&&& &&&&& Explorer 41 functioned very well from launch until it decayed from orbit on December 23, 1972 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

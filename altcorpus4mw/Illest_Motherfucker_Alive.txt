Illest Motherfucker Alive &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Illest Motherfucker Alive'''" (censored on the album as "'''Illest Motherf**ker Alive'''") is a song by American rappers Kanye West and Jay-Z. It is only available on their collaborative album ''Watch the Throne'' (2011) on the deluxe edition. The song features additional vocals by Kid Cudi, Bankulli, and Aude Cardona. It samples "Tristessa" by Orchestra Njervudarov for an interlude. &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& The song includes a sample of "Tristessa" by Orchestra Njervudarov for the interlude played before it, which is also used for the interludes played after fellow album tracks "No Church in the Wild", "New Day" and "Welcome to the Jungle". Producer Southside revealed in an interview that he's responsible for the drums, the snares, the hi-hat and the breakdowns, and also that mostly all the synths were added by West. Jay compares himself to The Beatles and Beyonc√© to Yoko Ono. &&&&& &&&&& Release and recording &&&&& "Illest Motherfucker Alive" is only available on ''Watch the Throne'' as a bonus track on the deluxe edition. The involvement of Southside was due to him being in the studio whilst Lex Luger was co-producing West's song "See Me Now" and being asked by West's manager for beats. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Brian Josephs of ''Complex'' viewed the track's presence on ''Watch the Throne'' as being "pretty much there for you to revere two impossibly rich black men". It was described by Simon Price of ''The Independent'' as "brilliantly absurd" and he pointed out West's lines: "Bulletproof condom when I'm in these hoes/Got staples on my dick. Why? Fuckin' centrefolds". &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& In the month of the album's release, the song peaked at number 4 on the US ''Billboard'' Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and never managed to chart on it again. &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2011) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 22 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

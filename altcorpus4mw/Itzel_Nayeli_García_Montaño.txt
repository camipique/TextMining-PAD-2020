Itzel Nayeli García Montaño &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Itzel Nayelí Montaño García''' (born 1995 in Chimalhuacán, State of Mexico, Mexico) is an supposed Mexican spree killer accused of a series of crimes committed in the municipality of Chimalhuacán. The series of attacks were random against strangers and were committed by a woman who attacked her victims in the back by stabbing their necks. In total, a total of 7 attacks occurred, 2 of them fatal. She was named "The Decapitator of Chimalhuacán" by the media. She was disorganized, sedentary and hedonistic, highlighting the fact that their attacks were committed "body to body", an unusual modus operandi in female spree killers. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Itzel Montaño was born in 1995, in Chimalhuacán, State of Mexico, in a poor family in which she was the second of six children, her father working unofficially as a "car washer". Her childhood was spent in a marginalized area of her home municipality, sharing a house with her parents, siblings and several relatives. She used to take care of her younger siblings while her parents worked, and was described by relatives and acquaintances as "quiet and calm". She studied only to the third grade, as her childhood and adolescence were marked by poverty. &&&&& &&&&& At the age of 14, she began to live in a free union with a man. At a young age she got pregnant for the first and only time - she suffered from an ectopic pregnancy, making it a necessity to undergo a hysterectomy in order to save her life, leaving her sterile. At age 16, she separated from her partner and then began to consume alcohol and tobacco excessively. For 18 years she used inhalants, and continued selling sweet outside the Mexico City Metro. She had difficulties with reading, writing and maths. At age 17, she met her second husband, a man named Rafael who drove a minibus. He moved in with him only after a few months of relationship. Their relationship was difficult, and fights often resulted in physical aggression. &&&&& &&&&& Crimes &&&&& On September 14, 2015, the first attack attributed to the Decapitator'','' the first victim being a man named Antonio Soto Leyva. The 43-year-old was attacked at 5:30 AM by a woman who approached him from behind and attacked, causing a 15-cm injury to his neck that did not harm no vital structure, from which the victim survived. Despite his injuries, he was able to pursue his attacker for 50 meters, but could not catch her. &&&&& &&&&& The first fatality attributed to the killer came just a day later, on September 15, when a 40-year-old woman named Rosario Laureano Ventura was attacked. The woman was travelling on a bus when she was repeatedly stabbed in the neck by a young woman. That same day there was a second attack, that of Rosa María Jímenez Martínez, who managed to survive. The second murder attributed to the murderer occurred on September 17, 2016, when a 16-year old woman, Brenda Chantal Mondragón Martínez, was assaulted while walking to her school. The killer sectioned her jugular vein. &&&&& &&&&& Throughout September 2015 there were at least 3 more attacks on two men and one woman, which were non-fatal. One of victims was José Alberto Pichardo, 36, who was stabbed in the abdomen and then in the neck; Pichardo came to declare that his attacker was "very fast", compared to a "ninja"''.'' &&&&& &&&&& Reaction and investigations &&&&& Soon the rumor began to spread that there was an active murderer in Chimalhuacán attacking randomly people on the streets. The neighbours began to form vigilante groups, arming themselves with sharp-pointed, blunt objects and firearms. Soon the media also began to cover the case and dubbed the alleged murderer as "The Decapitator of Chimalhuacán". A real mass hysteria was generated. &&&&& &&&&& With the collaboration of victims and some witnesses, the police developed a profile of the attacker - she was described as a woman between 20 and 25 years of age, with light brown skin, long dark hair, thin, well-dressed and with two tattoos of the Santa Muerte. At first, it was theorised that the attacker could be a man dressed as a woman, because this form is atypical to female murderers, but this hypothesis was rejected. &&&&& &&&&& There was no clear pattern in the victims, the modus operandi was all in the same - the attacker approached his victim from behind in a public space and stabbed their neck from the back with a pocket knife. The perpetrator's characteristics made the victims feel not threatened. All attacks occurred in the neighbourhoods of tanners, farmers, cabinet makers, artisans and fishermen, and occurred mostly in the morning. Patrols were started by police on a recurring basis in order to arrest a suspect. &&&&& &&&&& Detention, condemnation and motivations &&&&& On October 2, 2015, after 20 days of investigation, Montaño was arrested in the vicinity of her home in Chimalhuacán, after being denounced by her partner and a second man with whom she also worked in informal commerce. Both men reported that she tried to kill them by cutting their necks. She admitted these two attacks and confessed to have committed them under the influence of alcohol and solvents. Both attacks occurred on September 13, 2015; the aggression towards the partner occurred in the context of a domestic fight and the second, against a man named "Jorge", known as the "leader of the street vendors", occurred when he demanded money so that he could sell his sweets. At first the police denied that Montaño was related to the Decapitator's crimes, but by October 9, 2015, they rectified that statement and claimed that she was a suspect in the murders. &&&&& &&&&& On July 2017, Montaño was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a charge of attempted murder, and is still awaiting trial for other charges. Her motives remain unknown, but according to declarations of relatives, when she consumed inhalants her behaviour changed drastically, becoming violent and uninhibited. She is believed to have been on drugs in all the attacks, as well as the two attacks she confessed to. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

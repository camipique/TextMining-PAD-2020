Effects of Typhoon Morakot on Taiwan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Between August 6, 2009, and August 10, 2009, Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Morakot, which brought about unprecedented rainfall and flooding across the country. The incidents surrounding Typhoon Morakot are known as the '''Eight-Eight Flood''' (八八水災). The flooding is the most devastating flooding incident since the flooding caused by Typhoon Ellen in 1959. Typhoon Morakot is most remembered for the destruction of Siaolin Village in Jiasian, Kaohsiung. &&&&& &&&&& According to the Government of the Republic of China, 681 people died and 18 people went missing due to the typhoon. The Executive Yuan announced that all flags be placed at half-mast in mourning between August 22 and 24. The government was criticized for reacting slowly to the crisis, causing President Ma Ying-jeou's approval ratings to drop significantly and leading to the resignation of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan &&&&& &&&&& Direct Effects &&&&& &&&&& === Nantou County === &&&&& Provincial Highway 16 collapsed, causing seven cars to be washed into the Zhuoshui River. &&&&& The most damage done to Nantou County was in Xinyi, which had the greatest rainfall in the county. The currents of the Chenyoulan River caused the foundations of roads and buildings to be wiped away. A building in Longhua Elementary School tilted 30 degrees as a result of the foundations being washed away and was on the verge of falling into the river. &&&&& &&&&& Provincial Highway 16 collapsed between Jiji and Shuili, causing seven cars to be washed into the Zhuoshui River. So far, only four out of fifteen bodies have been recovered. &&&&& &&&&& === Tainan County === &&&&& Typhoon Morakot caused Zengwen Reservoir, which was originally short on water, to suddenly exceed capacity. In response to the excess water, the reservoir released over 100,000,000 liters of water, which is about 80% of the dam's total capacity. The release of water caused severe flooding along the Zengwen River; in Xiaobei Village in Madou Township, the water level reached a story high. &&&&& &&&&& === Kaohsiung County === &&&&& Mud covers the ground after the flooding in Qishan Township. &&&&& Landslides caused massive damage to buildings in Namaxia Township. &&&&& Kaohsiung County saw over 2,500 millimeters of rainfall within three days (Kaohsiung typically receives the same amount of rain in a year). The rain brought severe floods on the plains and landslides in the mountains. On August 14, Xiaolin Village was completely covered due to a landslide, causing the deaths of 398 people. &&&&& &&&&& Due to the rain, many bridges were washed away, including those on Provincial Highways 20, 21, and 27 and the bridge to the Maolin National Scenic Area. 14 people went missing after a weir under construction was washed away. &&&&& &&&&& === Pingtung County === &&&&& The army assisting in rebuilding in Jiadong Township. &&&&& Pingtung County is one of the areas hardest hit by the typhoon. Due to the collapse of embankment along the Linbian River, there was severe flooding in Linbian and Jiadong, with Jiadong reporting flood depths of two stories. Embankments along the Laonong River also collapsed, causing flooding in Gaoshu. A bridge on Provincial Highway 24 collapsed, effectively cutting off Wutai Township from the rest of the country. &&&&& &&&&& According to the Water Resources Agency, the area with the highest rainfall was in Wanluan Township with 135 millimeters per hour. The total highest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township with over 2500 millimeters. &&&&& &&&&& The railways in Pingtung also took a huge hit, with the Pingtung Line taking 6 months to repair. Linbian Train Station's train tracks were entirely covered in mud after severe flooding there. &&&&& &&&&& === Taitung County === &&&&& A broken bridge on the TRA South Link Line in Taimali Township. &&&&& Most of the flooding in Taitung County occurred in the south part of the county, with Daren, Taimali, and Dawu Townships being especially hard hit. &&&&& &&&&& Flooding was especially serious in Zhiben Hot Springs, with 200 meters of its main road washed away. On August 9, the Jinshuai Hotel's (金帥溫泉大飯店) foundations were washed away, and the eight-story hotel toppled over into the Zhiben River.

Since the coastal areas are lower in elevation, there was also widespread flooding in Dongshi, Budai, and Yizhu. Many villages in Alishan, Meishan, Zhuqi townships saw flooding and destruction done to their infrastructure. The Alishan Forest Railway saw some serious damage, and repairs took about a year. &&&&& &&&&& Central and North Taiwan saw some less severe flooding, with the most serious in Dacheng and Erlin in Changhua County. &&&&& &&&&& Losses &&&&& ; Agriculture &&&&& : The Council of Agriculture estimates that a total of $19.217 billion NTD was lost due to the typhoon, making it the second-costliest typhoon behind Typhoon Herb in 1996.

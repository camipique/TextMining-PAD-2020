1654	Franciscan_Monastery,_Plzeň
Franciscan Monastery, Plzeň &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Interior of Church of Assumption of Virgin Mary &&&&& &&&&& The '''Franciscan Monastery''' is located near the Main Square in Plzeň, Czech Republic. Originally Minorites, later Franciscan monastery was founded in the end of 13th century. Church of Assumpton of Virgin Mary, Chapterhouse and Chapel of St. Barbara also belong to the monastery complex. &&&&& &&&&& ''The Franciscan church and monastery are among the city's oldest buildings and, for all the calamities of the Hussite era and Thirty Years War, have, in essence, preserved their original early Gothic form.'' &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Foundation of the monastery goes back to the same time as foundation of Pilsen by king Wencleslaus II., which happened around 1295. The monastery originally belonged to Minorites. Along with the newly uprising city the complex started to grow south-eastern from the city ramparts. &&&&& &&&&& The oldest parts from 1300 are walls of the pentagonal presbytery and the eastern part of the triple nave. Later on, the rest of the triple nave and the intermediate arcade were built. The presbytery and the triple nave were vaulted after 1350. Eastern part of the cloister was vaulted around 1360. By 1380 the process of vaulting the remaining parts was done. The Minorites were banished from the monastery on the initiative of Hussite radical priest Václav Koranda. Few months later they were allowed to return. During the siege of Pilsen by Hussite army in the 1433-1434 a fire damaged the monastery. Thanks to the contributions it was possible to repair the destroyed monastery in following 50 years. On command of Pope Pius II. The Franciscans took over the monastery. &&&&& &&&&& In 1618 the monastery was damaged again during the siege of Pilsen by army of Czech aristocracy under the command of Lord Mansfield. The tower of the church was built at the end of 16th century. In 1611 additional chapel was built and consecrated to Holy Trinity. Wing for novices was built at the end of 17th century along with the Chapel of St. Anthony. The chapel was built next to the north nave of the church. Author of those two was Jakub Auguston senior. Later on, his nephew Jakub Auguston Jr. came to Pilsen and worked on the construction of the monastery as well. He is an author of the western facade of the monastery church (1722–24). The monkish community was probably the biggest at that time. During Josephines reforms the community was not disbanded, but the numbers of monks were reduced and were further more descending. &&&&& &&&&& Following reparations were completed in 19th century and in 30's of 20th century.The monkish community was disbanded because of “Action K” (Illegal brute liquidation of monasteries and male regular orders) in May 1950. During socialism the buildings were used as children's home and later as Museum of West Bohemia in Pilsen. When the political regime changed in 1989 the monastery was given back to hands of Roman Catholic Church, which started to renovate the buildings step by step based on the architectural concept by Jan Soukup. &&&&& &&&&& Nowadays the Museum of Christian Art of Pilsen Diocese takes place in the monastery's most interesting parts. Other spaces serve the purposes of Parish of Cathedral of St. Bartholomew and the Pilsen Bishopric. It also contains service apartments for people in charge of diocese and regular nuns. &&&&& &&&&& Church of Assumption of Virgin Mary &&&&& ===Triple nave=== &&&&& Small basilican triple nave is vaulted by four serveries of cross vault. Ogee moulded vaulting ribs are led into simple geometric console with polygonal cover. Eastern triple nave is ended by triumphal arch situated on ogee moulded semi-pillars. The nave is separated from its aisles by monumental cylindrical non profiled posts carrying Gothic arcade. The arcade is carrying smooth wall with small double windows which consist of different types of traceries, that illuminate the nave. South aisle is directly connected to monastic cloister. From the north aisle is possible to access the chapel of St. Anthony with octagonal plan. &&&&& &&&&& ===Presbytery=== &&&&& The nave continues as a long rectangular presbytery which is vaulted by three serveries of cross vault and is ended by pentagonal end with sexpartite vaulting. Walls of the presbytery were structured by round thin vaulting shaft, that remained still only in the tips and inside triumphal arch. Vault ribs are led into the consoles decorated with vegetal and animal motives. Triple windows with different traceries are late Gothic whereas the pillars supporting the presbytery on the outside are early Gothic. &&&&& &&&&& ===Other spaces=== &&&&& On the north side of presbytery there is late Renaissance chapel of holy trinity which was built 1611 and is standing on the basis of original Gothic chapel. It is possible to access the chapel from presbytery through the monumental Gothic portal with ogee moulded profile. The arch is decorated with crockets and top flower and it is finished with consoles with vegetal motif. Further, on the north side of presbytery in the corner of aisle there is rectangular tower reinforced by supportive pillars (today's Baroque look comes from 1676). South from the presbytery there is a sacristy which is vaulted by two serveries of cross vaulting. Vaulting ribs are led to the bosses. &&&&& &&&&& ===Equipment=== &&&&& Main Baroque altar was made in 1698. There is a copy of painting from P.P. Rubens from 1636. On the tabernacle there is a Gothic “Franciscan Madonna” dated around 1420. On the side altar there is a relief of St. Anne from 1525. &&&&& &&&&& Cloister &&&&& On the squared plan there is cross corridor which is on each side vaulted by four serveries of cross vaulting without the corner serveries. In the other parts of corridor there are vaulting ribs led to the wall without consoles. There where vaulting ribs cross there are sometimes bosses but not in every servery. The bosses are shaped partially like plates and are partially circular. Cloister goes around squared garden, which is possible to be seen through Gothic windows with flute profile. The garden is accessible from western wing through the doorway with a shouldered arch. In the eastern part of cloister there is late Gothic decorated pulpit from 1543 and small scriptorium. On some places we can still see late Gothic fresco. &&&&& &&&&& Chapterhouse and Chapel of St. Barbara &&&&& The chapterhouse can be entered from eastern wing of cloister by three Gothic portals. The chapterhouse has square plan. The chapel is connected to the presbytery of Chapel of St. Barbara. This connection of chapterhouse and chapel is unusual. The chapterhouse is vaulted by star vault with eight serveries. In the corners there are ogee moulded vaulting ribs ended with simple geometric consoles. Other vaulting ribs are led simply into the wall. This vault was built in 1460 the original one was probably similar and was done in the half of 14th century. It was destroyed by fire during Hussite Wars. But in the presbytery the vaulting is still original. It is made up of one rectangular cross vaulted servery and ends with pentagonal finish. Chapel is illuminated by three two-part Gothic windows with simple tracery. The same windows illuminate the chapterhouse from the eastern side. &&&&& Presbytery is separated from the nave by triumph Gothic arch which is composed of ogee moulded profile and flute profile which is connected to round vaulting shaft of the nave. There could still be found late Gothic scenes from life of St. Barbara from after 1460 on the walls and on the vaulting serveries. The chapel and the presbytery are illuminated by two-part Gothic windows. &&&&& &&&&& Other rooms in the Monastery &&&&& In the monastery there is also refectory, which was rebuilt into Baroque style in 1697 and was connected to kitchen. The kitchen was built as one huge open space room with smoke pipe intake over the whole plan until the modifications in 18th century. During those Baroque modifications the novice wing was built. &&&&& &&&&& Franciscans today in Pilsen &&&&& Franciscans came back to the Pilsen in 1996 on wish of bishop Františk Radkovský. The small community settled in apartment in Vinice. Later on they bought former kindergarten in Lochotín and it was adapted into pastoral center called “Domeček”. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& File:Plzeň Františk ambit DSCN0800.JPG|Cloister with exposition of Church Art Museum &&&&& File:Plzeň Františk skriptorium DSCN0793.JPG|Scriptorium &&&&& File:Plzeň Františk kap síň DSCN0797.JPG|Chapterhouse &&&&& File:Madona z Lochotína 1510 DSCN0791.JPG|Gothic Franciscan Madonna &&&&& File:Kostel Nanebevzetí Panny Marie pohled z předsíně.JPG|Church of Assumption of Virgin Marry &&&&& File:Portál v presbytáři vedoucí do kaple Nejsvětější trojice.JPG|Portal in presbytery leading to Chapel of Holy Trinity &&&&& File:Východní křídlo.JPG|Eastern wing &&&&& File:Klášterní ambit - východní křídlo.JPG|Cloister eastern wing &&&&& File:Jižní křídlo.JPG|South wing &&&&& File:Rajský dvůr.JPG|Garden &&&&& File:Kapitulní síň.JPG|Chapterhouse &&&&& File:Kaple svaté Barbory.JPG|Chapel of St. Barbara &&&&& File:Pohled na klášter ze západu.JPG|View from east side &&&&& File:Pohled na klášterní areál z východu.JPG|View on the monastery from west side &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& *Vlček, Sommer, Foltýn, Encyklopedie českých klášterů.

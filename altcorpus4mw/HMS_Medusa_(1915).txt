956	HMS_Medusa_(1915)
HMS Medusa (1915) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''HMS ''Medusa''''' was a of the British Royal Navy. She was one of four destroyers, of similar design to the British M-class ordered by Greece in June 1914, which the British purchased during construction owing to the outbreak of the First World War. &&&&& &&&&& ''Medusa'' (originally named ''Lesvos'') was launched by the Scottish shipbuilder John Brown in March 1915 and was completed in July that year. She entered service with the Harwich Force, but was abandoned after being badly damaged in a collision on 26 March 1916. &&&&& &&&&& Design &&&&& In 1914, rivalries between Greece and Turkey led to Greece placing large orders for new warships, including a from France and two light cruisers and four destroyers from Britain. The British ships were ordered from the Coventry Syndicate, a consortium of the shipbuilders John Brown, Fairfield and Cammell Laird and the armament manufacturer Coventry Ordnance Works. The cruisers were to be built by Cammell Laird while two destroyers each would be built by John Brown and Fairfield. &&&&& &&&&& The destroyers were of similar design to the contemporary M-class being built for the British Royal Navy, with the major difference being a modified machinery arrangement. &&&&& &&&&& The ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three Yarrow water-tube boilers fed steam to Brown-Curtis impulse steam turbines, driving two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at giving a speed of . The ship's boilers were arranged with two boilers in one large compartment adjacent to the engine room and one in a smaller compartment forward, while the British M-class had the larger boiler compartment forward and the small boiler compartment adjacent to the engine room. Three funnels were fitted. &&&&& &&&&& Armament consisted of three 4-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns and two twin 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The ship had a crew of 79. &&&&& &&&&& Service &&&&& The four destroyers were ordered in June 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War resulted in them being purchased by Britain in August 1914. The second of the two ships built by John Brown, named ''Lesvos'' by the Greeks, was launched at John Brown's Clydebank shipyard on 27 March 1915 and was completed in May that year. &&&&& &&&&& On commissioning, ''Medusa'' joined the Harwich Force. On 4–5 August 1915, ''Medusa'' took part in a sweep of four light cruisers and four destroyers of the Harwich Force against German torpedo-boats and trawlers that were believed to be patrolling off Terschelling. The force encountered no German surface forces, although a submarine, which quickly dived away, was sighted near the North Hinder light vessel. On 16 August 1915, 8 destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, including ''Medusa'', set out from Sheerness to escort the minelayer which was tasked with laying a minefield on the Arum Bank. On the afternoon of 17 August, the force encountered a number of neutral and German fishing trawlers, which were suspected of signalling to Germany by radio. One trawler, the ''Roland BX.40'', was boarded and scuttled by the destroyer , while ''Medusa'' stopped and searched a second German trawler, the ''Boreas'', while the remaining ships of the force continued on with the mission. As the search found no radio, and believing that orders stated that trawlers could only be captured is radios were found, ''Medusa'' released ''Boreas''. In fact, the commander of the operation, aboard ''Princess Margaret'', had ordered that all German trawlers be sunk as well as any neutral trawlers found with radios. Meanwhile, the operation was abandoned after the main force encountered a group of German destroyers, one of which , torpedoed and damaged the destroyer . &&&&& &&&&& On 24 March 1916, the Harwich Force set out on a raid by seaplanes launched by the seaplane carrier against a German airship base believed to be at Hoyer on the coast of Schleswig, with ''Medusa'' sailing as part of the escort. The air attack was launched early in the morning of 25 March. Two aircraft returned, reporting that the airship base was not at Hoyer as thought, but at Tondern further inland, and that they had been unable to attack it Two divisions of destroyers, including ''Medusa'', were ordered to search for the missing seaplanes. During the search, they encountered two German patrol boats, ''Braunschweig'' and ''Otto Rudolf'', which were quickly sunk by gunfire. During this engagement, the destroyer collided with ''Medusa''. ''Medusa''s engine room was holed and began to flood, meaning that ''Medusa'' lost all power and was unable to steam. ''Medusa'' was taken under tow by the destroyer leader . At first ''Lightfoot'' proceeded at a speed of with the two ships and escorting destroyers coming under frequent attack by German aircraft. As the day went on, the weather grew steadily worst, with frequent snow storms and heavy seas, and at 7:40 pm the tow-line parted with the ships still only from Horns Reef. Commodore Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, ordered ''Medusa''s crew to abandon ship. The destroyer took off ''Medusa''s crew, sustaining minor damage to her stem during the rescue operation, leaving ''Medusa'' apparently in sinking condition in heavy weather. Despite this, ''Medusa'' remained afloat, and was sighted by a Dutch trawler on 27 March. On hearing reports that ''Medusa'' was still afloat, the Royal navy sent three submarines, , and to search for her. On 3 April, ''Medusa'' was discovered by another Dutch trawler which took the destroyer under tow and towed her to Terschelling, but the destroyer ran aground on a sandbank at the entrance to Terschelling harbour on 5 April and was wrecked, with salvage attempts being abandoned on 22 April. &&&&& &&&&& Pennant numbers &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Pennant number &&&&& &&&&& Dates &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& H90 &&&&& &&&&& 1915– &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

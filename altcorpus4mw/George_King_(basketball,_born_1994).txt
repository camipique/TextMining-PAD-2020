George King (basketball, born 1994) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''George McZavier King Jr.''' (born January 15, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the Colorado Buffaloes, earning second-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12 as a senior in 2018. He was selected by the Suns in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft &&&&& &&&&& College career &&&&& King grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina before moving to San Antonio, where he played at William J. Brennan High School. He came to the University of Colorado at Boulder and played sparingly for the Buffaloes as a freshman. King and coach Tad Boyle mutually agreed for him to redshirt the next season for both academic and athletic reasons. The decision proved to be a good one, as King returned for the 2015–16 season and was named the Pac-12’s Most Improved Player after averaging 13.6 points and 4.7 rebounds per game. &&&&& &&&&& The next season, King's role adjusted as the team added future NBA guard Derrick White. King averaged 11.1 points and 6.8 rebounds as a junior. He declared for the 2017 NBA draft without an agent, but ultimately decided to return to Colorado for his senior season. In his final college season, King averaged 12.9 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, earning second-team All-Pac-12 honors. &&&&& &&&&& At the close of his career, King finished with 1,294 points and 681 rebounds, ranking him in the school’s all-time top 20 in both statistical categories. King also finished with 181 career three-pointers and shot .401 from the three-point line, good for finishing in the top-5 in school history when he graduated. &&&&& &&&&& Professional career &&&&& Following the close of his college career, King was named to the Reese's College All-Star Game, a showcase for senior professional prospects. King scored 21 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in the game, earning Most Outstanding Player honors for the East squad. King then moved to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, another pre-draft camp, where he averaged 18 points and 7.7 rebounds, earning all-tournament honors. King’s standout performances resulted in an invitation to the 2018 NBA Draft Combine. &&&&& &&&&& On June 21, 2018, King was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the 59th pick of the 2018 NBA draft. Ten days later, he was announced as one of the players for the Suns' 2018 NBA Summer League squad. On July 6, King signed with the Suns entering his rookie season. Unlike the team's other rookies, King signed a two-way contract with them, thus splitting his playing time with the Phoenix Suns and their NBA G League affiliate team, the Northern Arizona Suns. In his debut in the NBA G League on November 4, King recorded 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting, four rebounds, four assists and a block in a 118-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors. King made his NBA debut on December 11, 2018 in a 111-86 loss to the San Antonio Spurs, playing six minutes and grabbing a rebound with no points scored. &&&&& &&&&& Career statistics &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===NBA=== &&&&& ====Regular season==== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Phoenix &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 0 &&&&& &&&&& 6.0 &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& 1.0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& 0.0 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& 0 &&&&& &&&&& 6.0 &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& - &&&&& &&&&& 1.0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& 0.0 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===College=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2013–14 &&&&& &&&&& Colorado &&&&& &&&&& 27 &&&&& &&&&& 0 &&&&& &&&&& 5.5 &&&&& &&&&& .282 &&&&& &&&&& .200 &&&&& &&&&& .652 &&&&& &&&&& 1.5 &&&&& &&&&& .2 &&&&& &&&&& .1 &&&&& &&&&& .0 &&&&& &&&&& 1.5 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015–16 &&&&& &&&&& Colorado &&&&& &&&&& '''34''' &&&&& &&&&& 27 &&&&& &&&&& 25.4 &&&&& &&&&& .446 &&&&& &&&&& '''.456''' &&&&& &&&&& .748 &&&&& &&&&& 4.7 &&&&& &&&&& .7 &&&&& &&&&& .4 &&&&& &&&&& .2 &&&&& &&&&& '''13.6''' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2016–17 &&&&& &&&&& Colorado &&&&& &&&&& '''34''' &&&&& &&&&& '''31''' &&&&& &&&&& 27.7 &&&&& &&&&& '''.460''' &&&&& &&&&& .376 &&&&& &&&&& .671 &&&&& &&&&& 6.8 &&&&& &&&&& .7 &&&&& &&&&& '''.5''' &&&&& &&&&& .2 &&&&& &&&&& 11.1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017–18 &&&&& &&&&& Colorado &&&&& &&&&& 32 &&&&& &&&&& '''31''' &&&&& &&&&& '''28.5''' &&&&& &&&&& .445 &&&&& &&&&& .395 &&&&& &&&&& '''.782''' &&&&& &&&&& '''7.8''' &&&&& &&&&& '''1.1''' &&&&& &&&&& '''.5''' &&&&& &&&&& '''.7''' &&&&& &&&&& 12.9 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& 127 &&&&& &&&&& 89 &&&&& &&&&& 22.6 &&&&& &&&&& .444 &&&&& &&&&& .401 &&&&& &&&&& .731 &&&&& &&&&& 5.4 &&&&& &&&&& .7 &&&&& &&&&& .4 &&&&& &&&&& .3 &&&&& &&&&& 10.2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Throughout his life, his parents were involved in the U.S. military.

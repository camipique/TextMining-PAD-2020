Funny You Should Ask (2017 game show) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''''Funny You Should Ask''''' is a syndicated American game show which launched in 2017. It is distributed by Entertainment Studios and hosted by Jon Kelley. &&&&& &&&&& Regular panelists on the show include Gabriel Iglesias, Sherri Shepherd, Louie Anderson, Bill Bellamy, Sheryl Underwood, Jon Lovitz, Tim Meadows, Jack√©e Harry, Howie Mandel, Cedric the Entertainer, Caroline Rhea, and Anthony Anderson, as well as Byron Allen - who is also the creator and executive producer of the show. The program used "Happy" by Pharrell Williams as its theme song from its first season until being replaced by a production-equivalent in its second season. &&&&& &&&&& The series is slightly related in title and format to the 1968 version of ''Funny You Should Ask'', a game show which aired on ABC. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& Six celebrities are each asked for their answers to a trivia question, which usually results in a humorous answer. The two contestants are asked to determine if the answer is right or wrong. If each answer is correct, the contestant wins $100 in the first round, $200 in second, and $300 in third. The contestant with the most money on their scoreboard (the max amount is $1,800) wins the game and has a chance to win an additional $5,000 in the Big Money bonus round. &&&&& &&&&& In the bonus round, three questions are asked, and multiple celebrities give answers, only one of which is true. The questions get progressively harder, and more answers are given for each successive question: three for the first, four for the second, and six for the third and final question. The last answer for each question is almost always a ridiculous, but hilarious, zinger. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Funny You Should Ask (1968 game show) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Eastgate Consumer Mall &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Eastgate Consumer Mall''' was a shopping mall based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Remnants of the building can be found at the corner of U.S. Route 40 (Washington Street) and Shadeland Avenue. The mall was constructed in 1957, and had anchor stores such as Sears, J. C. Penney, H. P. Wasson and Company, and more. Despite the craft stores and Burlington still being there, the tenants were notified in March 2004 that the mall would close on June 30, 2004. &&&&& &&&&& Building re-use &&&&& The facility was sold in 2008 to Lifeline Data Centers, an Indianapolis-based data storage company. In 2010, Lifeline allowed Indiana Department of Public Safety to take some of the building up, reportedly an emergency center. In 2013, the Department of Public Safety left the building. In 2013, Chicago-based New Generation Power International partnered with Lifeline to install a 1 megawatt solar farm on the facility. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

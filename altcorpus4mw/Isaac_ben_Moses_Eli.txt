Isaac ben Moses Eli &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Isaac ben Moses Eli ha-Sefaradi''' was a fifteenth century Spanish Jewish mathematician, born at Oriola, Aragon. &&&&& &&&&& According to Steinschneider, he may have been one of the Spanish exiles of 1492, probably leaving to Constantinople. He wrote a mathematical work entitled ''Meleket ha-Mispar'', divided into three parts: (1) a theory of numbers, dealing with the first four rules and the extraction of square roots; (2) proportion, etc.; and (3) elementary geometry. The book is an introduction to Euclid, and begins with a definition of the science of figures. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& * Steinschneider, ''Bibliotheca Mathematica'', 1901, p. 74. &&&&& * Steinschneider, ''Jewish Literature'', p. 192. &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

In 1940 Rockingham went overseas as a Lieutenant with the Canadian Scottish Regiment, but after the Dieppe Raid of August 1942 he was transferred to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and promoted to Major.

Walter Rockingham worked for the Pacific Cable Board and took his family with him as he traveled world laying telegraph lines. In 1919 the Rockinghams moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where John Meredith stayed for two years before returning to Australia. In 1926 the family moved to Barbados, staying for two years. Following this the family moved to England, then back to Australia. In Australia Rockingham completed his Sixth Form at the Melbourne Grammar School, and subsequently enrolled in the University of Melbourne. After he ran out of money, Rockingham quit university and worked as a Jackaroo. Having retired, Walter purchased a piece of land at Millstream, British Columbia, on which he began a sheep farm. In 1930 John joined his parents in Canada, this time staying for good. He worked on the sheep farm for three years before enlisting in the Canadian Army. &&&&& &&&&& === Enlistment === &&&&& While working on the sheep farm Rockingham had played rugby for the Canadian Scottish Regiment in Victoria. Additionally, he rowed for the James Bay Athletic Association. In 1933 he enlisted in the regiment's 1st Battalion as a Private, but was quickly commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Rockingham served with the militia until 1939 and lived at the Bay Street Armoury. In these pre-war years Rockingham spent his time in a machine gun platoon. During this time he also worked for the British Columbia Electric Railway. On 11 January 1936 Rockingham married Mary Carlyle Hammond (1912-1997) of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Rockingham had met Hammond when she was giving the highland dance lessons that were mandatory for all officers in the Canadian Scottish. &&&&& &&&&& === World War II === &&&&& When war broke out in September 1939, the regiment was mobilized and assigned to protect vital areas around the city. In 1940 the regiment's 1st Battalion was selected to go overseas. Rockingham had recently been made a Captain, but was told that if he wanted to go with the battalion he would have to revert to his previous rank of Lieutenant, which he elected to do. The battalion traveled to Halifax from where sailed to Glasgow, and soon after arrival they transferred to Aldershot. There, Rockingham was appointed commander of a guard of honour for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, who visited that December. He was later sent to the Canadian company command school. Rockingham was at the school when Canada undertook the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. A significant portion of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry was killed during this raid, and Rockingham was subsequently transferred to the depleted regiment as a Major. Stationed on the south coast of England as part of the anti-invasion force, on 14 April 1943 Rockingham was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and made Commanding Officer of the regiment. On 19 February 1944, Rockingham was relived of his command and sent to the Staff College, Camberley for further training. Following the Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the RHLI went to France without Rockingham. However, their CO was soon wounded. Rockingham was removed from the Staff College, and on 18 July given command of the Regiment once more and sent to France. &&&&& &&&&& In July 1944 the RHLI was stationed near Caen. Rockingham fought with the regiment as it moved south towards Verrières.

In August he was again removed from the RHLI, and this time promoted to Brigadier and on 8 August made General Officer Commanding of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade. As GOC his first conflict with the 9th was the Battle of the Falaise Pocket from 12 to 21 August. In September 1944 he accepted the German surrender at Boulogne-sur-Mer after Operation Wellhit. In February 1945 Rockingham was placed in command of the 51st (Highland) Division in anticipation of the Rhine Crossing. For his part in the crossing he received his second DSO. Rockingham was in Emden, Germany on VE Day. &&&&& &&&&& === Inter-war period === &&&&& Following his demobilization, Rockingham returned to civilian life in 1946. He settled again in Victoria where he found work with his pre-war employer, the BC Electric Railway. His first position was as a personnel supervisor, however, in 1949 he transferred to Vancouver where he was promoted to Staff Assistant to the General Manager of Transportation. In early 1950 he became the company's superintendent. &&&&& &&&&& === Korea === &&&&& On 7 August 1950 while in his Vancouver office, Rockingham received a telephone call from Brooke Claxton, Minister of National Defence in Louis St. Laurent's Liberal government. Claxton offered Rockingham the opportunity to command a Canadian brigade that the government had decided to send into the Korean War. Rockingham accepted the appointment and prepared to go overseas with the new Brigade, called the Canadian Army Special Force (CASF), under the command of the United Nations. The brigade trained at Fort Lewis in Washington before travelling to Korea. Rockingham commanded the Brigade until 10 April 1952, when Mortimer Patrick Bogert took over command. &&&&& &&&&& === Later military career === &&&&& In April 1952 Rockingham returned to Ottawa to the National Defence Headquarters.

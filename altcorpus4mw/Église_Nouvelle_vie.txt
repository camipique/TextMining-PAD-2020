Église Nouvelle vie &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Église Nouvelle vie''' (or '''New Life church''' in English) is an Evangelical non-denominational megachurch in Longueuil, Canada, affiliated with Association chrétienne pour la Francophonie. The senior pastor is Claude Houde. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The church was founded in 1993 in Longueuil, Canada, starting with 50 members and pastored by Claude Houde. In 1998, following a massive ice storm causing severe cold and power cuts for more than a month, the church housed 500 homeless people for three weeks. It is recognized by the mayor as a public utility. In 2001, it inaugurated its current building including a 2,400-seat auditorium, the largest in Canada's Francophonie. In 2003, the church left the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. In 2005, the Institute of Theology for the Francophonie, near the premises of Nouvelle vie was founded. In 2006, the church began to draw over 3,000 people per week. In 2007, the church founded the Association chrétienne pour la Francophonie (Christian Association for the Francophonie), a network of Evangelical non-denominational churches. In 2010, Impact, a music group, was formed in the youth department of the church. In 2011, Nouvelle Vie had 4,000 members. In 2017, the Église Évangélique du Semeur Church located in La Prairie merged with the church. &&&&& &&&&& === Humanitarian programs === &&&&& The church founded Action Nouvelle Vie, a humanitarian organization that helps the poor. Regular food aid, clothing, education and reintegration assistance is available. The organization has its own board of directors and is therefore an independent body of the church. In 2015, the 2159, a youth center that aims to develop independence and prevent homelessness and delinquency, is open. &&&&& &&&&& Iglesia Nueva vida &&&&& The New Life Church also has a Spanish-speaking group, Iglesia Nueva vida, which offers worship services in Spanish. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Sébastien Fath, ''Dieu XXL, la révolution des mégachurches'', Éditions Autrement, France, 2008, p. 110, 132, 141-143, 171 &&&&& * Philippe Le Page, Megachurch pentecôtiste en contexte québécois : la religion vécue à l'Église Nouvelle Vie de Longueuil, Master's thesis in religious studies, UQAM, 31, Canada, 2015 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official Website &&&&& * Official Website of Iglesia Nueva vida &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

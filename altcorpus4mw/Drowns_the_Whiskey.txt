In it, the male narrator sings about his vain attempts to "drown" the memory of a former loved one by drinking whiskey, but instead observes that the memory of said lover "drowns the whiskey." &&&&& &&&&& Aldean said that he was a "big fan" of Lambert, and had wanted to do a second duet with her after "Grown Woman", an album track from his 2007 album ''Relentless''. After she expressed indifference to the first song he had suggested to her, he sent her "Drowns the Whiskey" and she agreed to perform on it. &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& The song reached No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart for chart dated August 25, 2018, where it then stayed for a further week.

It has sold 242,000 copies in the United States as of December 2018. &&&&& &&&&& Music video &&&&& The music video for the song was released on June 18, 2018. It retells the song's story in an "empty Nashville dive bar". &&&&& Live performances &&&&& Aldean performed the song live on the CMT Music Awards on June 6, 2018.

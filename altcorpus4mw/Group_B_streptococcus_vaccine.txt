Group B streptococcus vaccine &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& As of 2017 there is no effective vaccine to prevent Group B streptococcal infection, although research is ongoing. Vaccination is considered an ideal solution to prevent not only early- and late-onset disease but also GBS infections in adults at risk. &&&&& &&&&& There are a number of problems with giving antibiotics to women in labor, such antibiotic exposure risks including severe allergic reactions, and difficulties screening pregnant women for GBS. If pregnant women could be given a vaccine against GBS, this could potentially prevent most cases of GBS without the need for antibiotics or screening. &&&&& &&&&& Development of GBS vaccines for maternal immunization has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization on the basis of high unmet need. It has been estimated that such a vaccine could potentially prevent 231,000 infant and maternal GBS cases. &&&&& &&&&& Vaccine development &&&&& The capsular polysaccharide of GBS is the main candidate for the development of an effective vaccine. Protein-based vaccines are also being investigated. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

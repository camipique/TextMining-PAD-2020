Hope Downs &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Hope Downs''''' is the debut studio album by the Australian indie rock band Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever. It was released on 15 June 2018, through Sub Pop. The album title refers to the Hope Downs mine, which, according to the band, "refers to the feeling of standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to". The songs in the album generally have a theme of being alone. Critic Andy Cush says the album presents serene environments, calling it a "brief vacation". &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Hope Downs'' received universal acclaim in reviews from critics. Juan Edgardo Rodriguez of ''No Ripcord'' and Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''Rolling Stone'' praised the high quality of all of the songs. Critic Adam Turner-Heffer of ''Under the Radar'' wrote "perhaps the only disappointment here is that their sound doesn't feel particularly expanded upon in the long-player format". Despite this, Turner-Heffer considers ''Hope Downs'' an impressive debut album. &&&&& &&&&& Track list &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Accolades &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Publication &&&&& &&&&& Country &&&&& &&&&& Accolade &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Paste'' &&&&& &&&&& US &&&&& &&&&& The 50 Best Albums of 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

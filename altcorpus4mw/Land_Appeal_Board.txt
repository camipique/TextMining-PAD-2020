It advises the government on issues concerning land management and land administration. It is responsible for evaluating decisions made by land courts, upazila chairmen, and upazila members.

The Board of Revenue continued to function independently until the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971 when it duties were than assigned to the Land Administration and Land Reforms Division under the Ministry of Law and Land Reforms. In 1973 the Land Administration and Land Reforms Division became the new Ministry of Land and the Board of Revenue was abolished. The Land Appeal Board was created through the Land Appeal Board Act 1989 which passed through the parliament and was signed into law by the President of Bangladesh on 31 May 1989. The Board of Land Administration was split into two boards, the Land Appeals Board and the Land Reform Board.

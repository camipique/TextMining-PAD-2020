It peaked at #35 on the Oricon DVD Charts, where it remained for two consecutive weeks. Included with the DVD was a twenty-page photo-book. &&&&& &&&&& While the tour was predominately composed of music from their third studio album ''Lead! Heat! Beat!,'' it also carried music from both their debut album ''Life On Da Beat'' (2003) and second album ''Brand New Era'' (2004). Unlike their first tour (''Lead 1st live tour ~BRAND NEW ERA~''), the concert was not released on VHS and only released on DVD. Bonus features on the DVD included a ten minute long behind-the-scenes making, including dance rehearsals and interviews. &&&&& &&&&& During the tour, the group performed the unreleased song "LD style". The song would remain a tour-exclusive, never garnering an official release on a single or album. &&&&& &&&&& The term "upturn" utilized in the title would end up becoming the name of all of their corresponding concert tours. &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& ===DVD=== &&&&& #"Rock the House &&&&& &&&&& ~Opening~" &&&&& #"Prism" &&&&& #"Freedom No Rule" &&&&& #"Night Deluxe" &&&&& #"What cha gonna?" &&&&& #"Love Magic" &&&&& #"Fly Away" &&&&& #"ACT -AIR MOVE-" &&&&& #"I believe" &&&&& #"LD style" &&&&& #"Extreme girl" &&&&& #"True Romance" &&&&& #"DANCE CORNER -mini ART world-" &&&&& #"Atarashii Kisetsu e" &&&&& #"Dear" &&&&& #"Steppin' out"'''' &&&&& #"Hateshinaku Hiroi Kono Sekai no Nakade" &&&&& #"Manatsu no Magic" &&&&& #"Delighted"'''' &&&&& #"Jump around" &&&&& #"Baby Runnin' Wild" &&&&& #"Funky Days!"'''' &&&&& #"Off-Shot Video" &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& &&&&& Chart &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& December 7, 2005 &&&&& &&&&& Oricon DVD Charts &&&&& &&&&& 35 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Lead Official Site &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

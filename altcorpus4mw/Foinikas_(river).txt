He mentions the river as a landmark for the ancient city of Aigio: "The territory of Aegium (Aigio) is crossed by a river Phoenix, and by another called Meganitas, both of which flow into the sea". In 1874 the researcher and chronicler Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria did a research trip by boat in the Gulf of Corinth and he wrote a detailed book with his observations for the landscape and the populated places of the northern Peloponnese. He names the river Foinikas as "Salmenikiotikos potamos" (meaning river that comes from Salmeniko). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

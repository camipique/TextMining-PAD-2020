Linda Louise Duan &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Linda Louise Duan''' (born 13 December 1993) is a British-Chinese actress known for her brief portrayal of Tina Minoru in the 2016 film ''Doctor Strange''. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Duan was born in Chester before moving to Essex. After graduating high school, Duan initially was going to take architecture at Architectural Association School of Architecture (a course that would have taken seven years), but soon became interested in taking a mime course with Desmond Jones after seeing it online. "Desmond was the man who got me to reconsider my options of pursuing something outside of a standard degree... He later went on and told me about other specialist schools that I would not have known much about... I thought about it carefully and decided to talk to my Dad about this possibility....with his blessing, I went down that road!" After graduating, Duan began to audition for roles. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Duan was in Israel working with Oleg Maltsev when she was contacted by assistant director Holly Gardner to audition for a secret project. When she learned that it involved Marvel Studios, she immediately flew back to London to audition. She eventually learned that it was ''Doctor Strange'' and began to research her character. Duan found the role invigorating despite the character's limited appearance, but hopes that it would open doors for other actresses. "I want to be a good role model for Chinese girls growing up. When I was growing up I had Barbie dolls with blonde hair and blue eyes and that’s what my perception of beauty was because that’s what I was exposed to...I want to see more characters like Mulan." &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Duan practices karate in her spare time. &&&&& &&&&& Filmography &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Title &&&&& &&&&& Role &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2016 &&&&& &&&&& ''Operation: Fringe'' &&&&& &&&&& Cassie Blackly &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2016 &&&&& &&&&& ''Doctor Strange'' &&&&& &&&&& Tina Minoru &&&&& &&&&& Cameo appearance &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2016 &&&&& &&&&& ''The Realm Beyond'' &&&&& &&&&& Tina &&&&& &&&&& Short film; also producer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& &&&&& ''Sinners'' &&&&& &&&&& Black Lotus &&&&& &&&&& Short film; also producer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& &&&&& ''Shadow Warriors'' &&&&& &&&&& Red Flame &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& &&&&& ''The Breadwinner'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& End credits music video producer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2017 &&&&& &&&&& ''Journey's End'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Behind the scenes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& ''Beautified'' &&&&& &&&&& Alice &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& ''Whisper'' &&&&& &&&&& Sam &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& ''Bohemian Rhapsody'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Stunt performer &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& ''Chopsticks &&&&& &&&&& '' &&&&& &&&&& Shu &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2019 &&&&& &&&&& ''Barber Fight'' &&&&& &&&&& Li Min &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2019 &&&&& &&&&& ''The Dark Kingdom'' &&&&& &&&&& Louza &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& TBA &&&&& &&&&& ''I Am Not The Devil'' &&&&& &&&&& Duan &&&&& &&&&& Short film &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

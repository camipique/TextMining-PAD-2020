After a successful month long run, the musical earned a slot at the 2014 New York Musical Theatre Festival, where in addition to positive critical reviews, it won the Steele Spring Stage Rights Publishing Award as well as the award for Excellence in Overall Design, which Kime shared with co-sound designer Rick Lombardo, costume designer Frances Nelson McSherry and lighting/projection designer David Lee Cuthbert. &&&&& &&&&& In 2015, Kime led an artistic team in Atlanta in writing an experimental and immersive musical adaptation of The Red Book (Jung) by Carl Jung.

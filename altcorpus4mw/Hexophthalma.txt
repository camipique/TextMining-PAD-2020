410	Hexophthalma
Hexophthalma &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Hexophthalma''''' is a genus of spiders in the family Sicariidae. Although the genus was originally erected in 1878 (then with the name ''Hexomma''), it was merged into the genus ''Sicarius'' in the 1890s, and remained unused until revived in 2017, when it was discovered that the African species then placed in ''Sicarius'' were distinct. The English name '''six-eyed sand spiders''' is used for members of the genus, particularly ''Hexophthalma hahni''. Species in the genus have necrotic (dermonecrotic) venom, and can potentially cause serious or even life-threatening wounds. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& The genus was first created in 1878 by Friedrich Karsch as ''Hexomma'', with the sole species ''Hexomma hahni''. However, by 1879, Karsch had realized that this name had already been used in 1877 for a species of harvestman, so he published the replacement name ''Hexophthalma''. In 1893, Eugène Simon transferred ''Hexophthalma hahni'' to the genus ''Sicarius'', and ''Hexophthalma'' fell out of use, until a phylogenetic study in 2017 showed that the African species of ''Sicarius'', including ''Sicarius hahni'', were distinct, and revived the genus ''Hexophthalma'' for them. &&&&& &&&&& ''Hexophthalma'' is one of three genera in the family Sicariidae, . It is placed in the same subfamily, Sicariinae, as ''Sicarius'': &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Species=== &&&&& Two new species were added to the genus in 2018, and one previously accepted species, ''H. testacea'', synonymized with ''H. hahnii''. The number of species is expected to increase with further study. ''H. spatulata'' differs in a number of respects from other species in the genus, which may thus not be monophyletic. &&&&& &&&&& , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following extant species: &&&&& *''Hexophthalma albospinosa'' (Purcell, 1908) – Namibia, South Africa &&&&& *''Hexophthalma binfordae'' Lotz, 2018 – Namibia &&&&& *''Hexophthalma damarensis'' (Lawrence, 1928) – Namibia &&&&& *''Hexophthalma dolichocephala'' (Lawrence, 1928) – Namibia &&&&& *''Hexophthalma goanikontesensis'' Lotz, 2018 – Namibia &&&&& *''Hexophthalma hahni'' (Karsch, 1878) (type species) – Namibia, South Africa &&&&& *''Hexophthalma leroyi'' Lotz, 2018 – South Africa &&&&& *''Hexophthalma spatulata'' (Pocock, 1900) – South Africa &&&&& &&&&& Venom &&&&& Species of ''Hexophthalma'' produce venom that can have necrotic (dermonecrotic) effects, capable of causing serious or even life-threatening wounds, particularly if the wound becomes infected or the venom spreads in the body. The necrotic effects are caused by a family of proteins related to sphingomyelinase D, present in the venom of all sicariid spiders. In this respect, the genus resembles ''Loxosceles'', the recluse spiders. However, most ''Hexophthalama'' species have only been studied ''in vitro'', and the detailed effects of their venom in humans and other vertebrates are unknown. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * – includes southern African ''Sicarius'', now ''Hexophthalma'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

173	Hitfist_OWS
Hitfist OWS &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Oto Melara has developed and sold a remotely operated turret, for armored vehicles, they call '''Hitfist OWS'''.  &&&&& &&&&& The turrets are designed to mount a main armament of an autocannon of 25 or 30 mm. The main armament may mount a co-axial machine gun. A variant allows the operator to aim and fire anti-tank missiles.  &&&&& &&&&& The turret is normally operated by a gunner who remains inside the vehicle, using remote optics and remote control. However, in the event of a power failure, the gunner can use a hatch primarily designed for reloading ammunition to aim and fire the turrets weapons manually. &&&&& &&&&& In 2010 Oto Melara licensed Bumar-Labedy, a manufacturer in Poland, to manufacture the turret for Poland's armed forces.  &&&&& &&&&& Oto Melara also sells a smaller remotely operated turret, named hitrole, that mounts smaller weapons, like machine guns and automatic grenade launchers. &&&&& &&&&& Oto Melara sells a similar appearing 2 man turret, called simply hitfist, where the gunner and commander operate the turret, and its weapons, directly. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

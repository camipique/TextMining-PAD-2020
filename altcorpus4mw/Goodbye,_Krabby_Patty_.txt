In this episode, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs seek business advice from an ad executive in Mr. Krabs' endeavor to launch a line of frozen Krabby Patties. Once Mr. Krabs gains success from this, he stops selling fresh Krabby Patties and turns the Krusty Krab into a museum, which means SpongeBob must save the Krabby Patty, as well as his friendship with Patrick.

Mr. Krabs then walks by and grabs a box full of frozen food, at which he marvels because of its convenience. SpongeBob sees this and gets the idea to sell frozen Krabby Patties, speculating that people will love them because of how convenient they are. Mr. Krabs hears this and decides to carry out with this idea. Mr. Krabs, along with the help of SpongeBob and his daughter Pearl, create their own cheaply made advertisement for the Frozen Krabby Patty, which he presents to the businessman Don Grouper, who, despite not being impressed with their "commercial," decides to help Mr. Krabs create an ad campaign to promote the Frozen Krabby Patties due to the immense potential that the idea has. Grouper hypothesizes that to create a successful ad, they would need someone who could represent the target audience for this new product, which would make the commercial itself more relatable, and therefore memorable. The new face of Frozen Krabby Patties ends up being Patrick Star. After the first commercial airs, Grouper tells Mr. Krabs that he will make even more money if he changes the recipe and adds some "filler," much to SpongeBob's dismay. While touring the factory, SpongeBob notices sand being used in the recipe for Patties, which Mr. Krabs tells him to ignore. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets his first huge revenue check for the Frozen Krabby Patties. The new Patties are a monstrous success, and everyone seems to be enjoying them, despite some noticeable side effects. &&&&& &&&&& Mr. Krabs fires SpongeBob from his fry cook job, and then immediately rehires him to work in the Krusty Krab museum, which documents the complete history of the Krusty Krab, complete with animatronic versions of the employees, and merchandise, which includes the Frozen Krabby Patties themselves. Squidward is also fired by Mr. Krabs, but unlike SpongeBob, he doesn't get a job at the museum. Squidward takes solace in the fact that he can finally live out his dreams. SpongeBob is noticeably disheartened, but he decides to make the best of this situation. &&&&& &&&&& Patrick becomes a major celebrity due to the success of the new commercials, but because of this, his friendship with SpongeBob seems to be slowly fading. SpongeBob visits Patrick in his lavish new home but is ridiculed by the snooty new people that are associating themselves with him. SpongeBob tries to have some fun with his friend, but Patrick is pulled away for an important photo shoot. Also, Patrick's 400th commercial is coming up soon, which makes everyone else very excited. &&&&& &&&&& SpongeBob heads back to the museum, where he finds Squidward, who gets hired after he wasn't successful in his quest to make his dreams. Later on, Plankton comes by and tries to take the formula and realizes that all traces of the old Krusty Krab are souvenirs. SpongeBob eats a frozen Krabby Patty and discovers that they're made of sand, which was the "filler" that SpongeBob heard about before from Don Grouper. SpongeBob reads the real secret formula and cooks up a fresh one, and then runs over to Patrick. SpongeBob tells Patrick that the patties are made of sand. SpongeBob then gives Patrick the one he just cooked, which rekindles his love for the sandwich. Patrick says he has a shareholders meeting in a few hours and doesn't know how he'll be able to talk positively about the new Krabby Patties because they taste so bad. At the shareholders meeting, Grouper and Mr. Krabs are proud that the Frozen Krabby Patty ad campaign has been such a success, and are about to unveil their long-awaited, 400th commercial. However, Patrick reveals that the Patties are made of sand, which exposes Don Grouper as a fraud. Soon, everyone begins to vomit up the sand. &&&&& &&&&& The depressed Mr. Krabs wanders over to the Krusty Krab, where he's confused when he sees that it is filled with customers enjoying the homemade patties that they love. He goes in the kitchen, where he sees SpongeBob and Patrick cooking the fresh patties. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob how much him and Patrick are charging for the patties, which turns out to be nothing at all. Mr. Krabs then makes a deal with SpongeBob that he can be their boss again, and charge actual money for the patties. SpongeBob happily agrees and everything returns to normal. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& This special of SpongeBob was written by Kyle McCulloch, storyboarded by Fred Osmond, and directed by Sherm Cohen and Dave Cunningham, with Alan Smart and Tom Yasumi serving as animation directors. &&&&& &&&&& Merchandising &&&&& Nickelodeon and Little Golden Books released a book based on the episode called ''Factory Fresh!''

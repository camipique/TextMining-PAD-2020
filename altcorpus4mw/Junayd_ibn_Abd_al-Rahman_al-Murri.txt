Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri''' was the Arab governor of Sindh from 723-726 A.D.. He started invading Indian kingdoms. After subduing Sindh, Junayd sent campaigns to various parts of India. The justification was that these parts had previously paid tribute to Bin Qasim but then stopped. The first target was ''al-Kiraj'' (possibly Kangra valley), whose conquest effectively put an end to the kingdom. A large campaign was carried out in Rajasthan which included ''Mermad'' (Maru-Mala, in Jaisalmer and north Jodhpur), ''al-Baylaman'' (Bhillamala or Bhinmal) and ''Jurz'' (Gurjara countryâ€”southern Rajasthan and north Gujarat). Another force was sent against ''Uzayn'' (Ujjain), which made incursions into its country (Avanti) and some parts of it were destroyed (the city of ''Baharimad'', unidentified). Ujjain itself may not have been conquered. A separate force was also sent against ''al-Malibah'' (Malwa, to the east of Ujjain), but the outcome is not recorded; probably successful. &&&&& &&&&& Towards the North, the Arabs attempted to expand into Punjab, but they could not advance beyond Multan. While the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate was a factor in this, art historian Hermann Goetz theorizes that the resistance from Lalitaditya Muktapida, the emperor of Kashmir, may also have played a part in this. Historian Mohibbul Hasan theorizes that Junayd marched towards Kashmir, but was defeated by Lalitaditya. Another force was dispatched south. It subdued ''Qassa'' (Kutch), ''al-Mandal'' (perhaps Okha), ''Dahnaj'' (unidentified), ''Surast'' (Saurashtra) and ''Barus'' or ''Barwas'' (Broach). &&&&& &&&&& The kingdoms weakened or destroyed included the Bhattis of Jaisalmer, the Gurjaras of Bhinmal, the Mauryas of Chittor, the Guhilots of Mewar, the Kacchelas of Kutch, the Maitrakas of Saurashtra and the Gurjaras of Nandipuri. Al-Junayd might be dismissed by the Umayyad Caliphate. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

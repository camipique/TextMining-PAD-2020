It is played from a first-person perspective.

Players can use attachments for different weapons, which can be found scattered throughout each level.

Batteries are used to power turrets and traps, attachments give each weapon a perk and credits are for being able to construct defences. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& Digital Cybercherries were awarded an Unreal Dev Grant which helped to further fund Hypercharge: Unboxed. It is built in the Unreal Engine 4. The game is now on Steam Early Access, and the developers are planning to put out the full version before the end of 2018. &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

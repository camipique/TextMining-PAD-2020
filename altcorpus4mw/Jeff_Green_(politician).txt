Jeff Green (politician) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Jeffrey Edwin Green''' (born 5 May 1957) is a British Conservative politician and former leader of Wirral Council between 2010 and 2011 and in 2012. He was the first Conservative to hold the role in 24 years. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Political career &&&&& ===Councillor=== &&&&& Green was first elected to Wirral Council in 1986 in the Tory safe seat of Thurstaston. After boundary change in 2004, Thurstaston was abolished and Green was successfully re-elected to the new West Kirby and Thurstaston ward. &&&&& &&&&& ===Conservative Leader=== &&&&& In 2002, he succeeded John Hale as leader of the Conservative group, a role he held until 2017 when he lost a leadership challenge to Wallasey councillor Ian Lewis. &&&&& &&&&& ===Leader of Wirral Council=== &&&&& Green was first elected leader on the 24 May 2010 after forming an alliance with the Liberal Democrats branded a “Coalition of Losers.” by outgoing Labour leader Steve Foulkes. Green's reign lasted less than a year before the Lib Dems withdrew their support citing that, after the 2011 election, “they were not given a mandate to continue running the council as part of a coalition.” and Labour's Steve Foulkes resumed office. &&&&& &&&&& After a Vote of no confidence in Steve Foulke's leadership on 13 February 2012, Green once again became council leader continuing until the Labour Party took control of the council at the 2012 election. He was succeeded by Phil Davies. &&&&& ;Anna Klonowski report &&&&& During his first stint as Leader, Green commissioned a report into claims of whistleblower Martin Morton, a former social services employee, who was bullied out of his job after revealing systematic financial abuse of vulnerable people in council care. The report discovered that a “corrosive culture” existed within the authority in which the “abnormal has become commonplace.” &&&&& ;Attempted smear campaign &&&&& In 2016, a £17,000 inquiry revealed that ex-Labour council leader Steve Foulkes had broken the council code of conduct and brought the council into disrepute over a leaked telephone conversation he had had with four whistleblowers. Foulkes denied ever using the recording to “smear” Green. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Green lives in Irby with his wife Carol, a local head teacher. The couple have two daughters. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

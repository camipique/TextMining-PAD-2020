Ida Barr (singer) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ida Barr''' (17 January 1882 â€“ 17 December 1967) was an English music hall singer. &&&&& &&&&& Life and career &&&&& Barr was born at Regent's Park Barracks, London on 17 January 1882. Her father was a soldier. &&&&& &&&&& She made her stage debut in 1898 as a chorus girl at the Theatre Royal, Belfast. Initially calling herself ''Maud Laverne'', she first used the stage-name Ida Barr in 1908 at London's Bedford Theatre. &&&&& &&&&& Barr married comedian Gus Harris (billed as "the only Yiddisher Scotsman in the Irish Fusiliers"), but left him in 1910, sailing to New York. Achieving some success in America, Barr returned to England a premier singer of ragtime songs, popularising in Britain the songs "Oh, You Beautiful Doll" (Ayer & Brown; 1910) and "Everybody's Doing It" (Berlin; 1911). &&&&& &&&&& She toured worldwide, earning good money, but was over-generous and failed to save. She became in her old age reliant on welfare benefits, living in a small flat off the Charing Cross Road in London. Writer and broadcaster Daniel Farson, a music hall enthusiast, took it upon himself to extend a helping hand, bringing Barr to a new (or nostalgic) audience on record and television. It was through Farson, too, that variety entertainer Danny La Rue arranged a benefit concert for Barr. &&&&& &&&&& Death &&&&& Ida Barr died on 17 December 1967 in London. &&&&& &&&&& Film and TV credits &&&&& Barr's screen credits span the years 1936 to 1966. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Film credits=== &&&&& *''Happy Days Are Here Again'' (1936) &&&&& *''Laugh It Off'' (1940) &&&&& *''Let the People Sing'' (1942) &&&&& &&&&& ===TV credits=== &&&&& *''Music Hall Cavalcade'' (1937) &&&&& *''Stars and Garters'' (1965) &&&&& *''Love Story'' (1966) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Trivia &&&&& *Actress Elsa Lanchester performed in her youth a snake dancing routine with Ida Barr. &&&&& *Ida Barr's name was appropriated more than 40 years after her death by Christopher Green for an unrelated, non-tribute drag act. &&&&& *Ida Barr was (through her marriage to Gus Harris) a great-aunt of actress and singer Anita Harris. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * Photographs of Ida Barr held by the National Portrait Gallery &&&&& * Photographs of Ida Barr held by Getty Images &&&&& * Photograph of Ida Barr held by the National Library of Australia &&&&& * Ida Barr discography on Discogs &&&&& * Ida Barr: ''Everybody's Doing It Now''/''Oh, You Beautiful Doll'' on Spotify &&&&& * Ida Barr: ''Everybody's Doing It Now''/''Oh, You Beautiful Doll'' on Deezer &&&&& * Lyrics to "Oh, You Beautiful Doll" as sung by Ida Barr &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

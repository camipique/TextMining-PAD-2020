154	Inticetus
Inticetus &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Inticetus''''' is an extinct genus of Early Miocene odontocete from the Chilcatay Formation, Pisco Basin, Peru. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& ''Inticetus'' is distinguished from other archaic heterodont odontocetes by the following features: long and robust rostrum bearing at least 18 teeth per quadrant; the absence of procumbent anterior teeth; many large, broad-based accessory denticles in double-rooted posterior cheek teeth; a reduced ornament of dental crowns; the styliform process of the jugal being markedly robust; a large fovea epitubaria on the periotic, with a correspondingly voluminous accessory ossicle of the tympanic bulla; and a shortened tuberculum of the malleus. &&&&& &&&&& Classification &&&&& ''Inticetus'' was judged by Lambert et al. to be sufficiently distinct from other archaic heterodont odontocetes to be placed in a new family, Inticetidae. The authors recovered it as either outside crown Odontoceti or as an early-branching member of Platanistoidea. &&&&& &&&&& ''Phococetus'', previously assigned to Kekenodontidae, is apparently a relative of ''Inticetus''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

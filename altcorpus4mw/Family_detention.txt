Family detention &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Family detention''' is the detention of multiple family members together in an immigration detention context. The places where it is done have been alternatively called '''family detention camps''' or '''family detention centers''' or '''family detention facilities''' by different sources. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In 2014 the Obama administration opened new family detention centers in the United States. At the time there was only one government-operated facility, which was located York County, Pennsylvania. &&&&& &&&&& In 2015, intact families were not regularly separated at the United States border. &&&&& &&&&& In February 2016, the designation '''Family Unit Aliens''' or '''FMUA''' was introduced. The majority of families apprehended at the border were not linked to fraud according to an official within U.S. Customs and Border Protection. &&&&& &&&&& In July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court's decision (in July 2015, by Judge Dolly Gee) to quickly release child migrants from family detention even when accompanied by a parent. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017 and 2018, the number of family units (groups of at least one adult and at least one child) from Guatemala and Honduras apprehended by the U.S. increased, as families fled gang violence and instability in Central America. &&&&& &&&&& Family detention centers in the United States &&&&& The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts with several facilities to detain families with children. The General Accounting Office reports that the 3 active facilities have a combined capacity of 3,326 people. Active family detention centers include: &&&&& &&&&& * South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. This privately-owned center is operated by CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America). The facility can hold 2,400 people and had 2,000 inmates in early June 2018. &&&&& * Berks County Residential Center in Leesport, Pennsylvania. This county-operated facility opened in 2011 as a 96-bed facility with space for 200 people. It was 59% full in early June 2018. ICE reported 25 people being held in April 2019. &&&&& * Karnes County Residential Center (KCRC) in Karnes City, Texas. This privately-operated center is run by the GEO Group. The facility opened in 2012, and was designated a family residential unit in 2014. The facility can hold 830 people and was 66% full in early June 2018. In April 2019,. 25 people were being held. &&&&& &&&&& === Former family detention facilities === &&&&& Former family detention centers include: &&&&& * T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas. This privately-owned center is operated by CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America). The facility opened in May 2006, and housed 400 immigrants including 170 children in February 2007. ICE used the facility for family detention until 2009. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in Federal court objecting to conditions at Hutto. Under terms of a 2009 settlement, ICE no longer holds children at Hutto, but continues to detain adult immigrant women at the facility. &&&&& *Artesia Family Residential Center in Artesia, New Mexico. A government-operated facility on the premises of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center that operated from June 2014 to December 2014, with space for 700 people. On November 20, 2014, the government announced it would transfer remaining detainees to the center in Karnes City, Texas. During the facility's operation, the Department of Homeland Security implemented a "no bond or high bond" strategy to make it difficult for women to leave the facility while awaiting immigration hearings. &&&&& &&&&& === Proposed family detention facilities === &&&&& Executive Order 13841, signed on June 20, 2018, instructs that, "The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law." On June 21, the Department of Health and Human Services requested facilities to house migrant children. Pentagon spokesmen and a memorandum sent to Congress confirmed that the Department of Defense was preparing facilities at four military bases in Texas and Arkansas to house 20,000 "unaccompanied alien children." &&&&& &&&&& * Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texasâ€”On June 25, the Associated Press reported that Fort Bliss had been chosen to house migrant families. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Flores Agreement &&&&& *Muamar family detention incident (Israel) &&&&& *South Texas Family Residential Center and T.

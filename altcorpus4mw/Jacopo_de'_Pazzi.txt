Jacopo de' Pazzi &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jacopo de' Pazzi''' (1423 - April 30, 1478) became head of the Pazzi in 1464. He, his nephew Francesco, and his brother Renato were executed after the Pazzi conspiracy on 26th April 1478. &&&&& &&&&& The conspiracy was proposed in Montughi, at Jacopo Pazzi's villa, and it was planned to kill Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici and take over the government of Florence. After the conspiracy, Jacopo went home and he found Francesco with a wound in one leg, possibly self-inflicted. With 100 armed men, Jacopo ran through the streets crying "Liberty!", but when Francesco was dragged from his bed and hanged, Jacopo escaped from Florence. In the village of Castagno he was recognised and sent back to Florence where he was hanged. &&&&& &&&&& Stefano di Ser Niccolo da Bagnone served as a secretary to Jacopo and tutor to his daughter Caterina. Palazzo Pazzi was commissioned by Jacopo between 1462 and 1472. &&&&& &&&&& In popular culture &&&&& In the second season of ''Medici: Masters of Florence'' (2016), Sean Bean appeared as Jacopo de' Pazzi. He appeared in the video game ''Assassin's Creed II'' (2009), where he was killed by Rodrigo Borgia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

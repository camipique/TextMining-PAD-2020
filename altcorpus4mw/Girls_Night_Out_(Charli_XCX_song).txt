Girls Night Out (Charli XCX song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Girls Night Out'''" is a single by English singer and songwriter Charli XCX. It was released on 26 July 2018 by Asylum Records and Atlantic Records UK as the third installment from a series of monthly single releases. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& Following numerous live performances, a demo of the song surfaced online in 2017. The track was later finalized and mastered for its official release, featuring additional vocal production and ad-libs during the bridge. On July 25, 2018, the song was officially confirmed as the next of Charli XCX's monthly singles, to be released later that week. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Althea Legaspi of ''Rolling Stone'' labeled the song as a "thumping, club-ready track". Henry Youtt of ''Billboard'' named the song a "peppy party anthem". Douglas Greenwood of ''NME'' thought of Girls Night Out as "the definitive antidote to everything bad in our lives. This song could reverse the effects of global warming. It could slash the cost of living in London to the price of a bottle of Lambrini. It's skin-cleansing; life-affirming – everything Charli XCX fans have ever wanted." &&&&& &&&&& Live performances &&&&& The song was premiered by Sophie at the Output club in Brooklyn, New York in July 2015. From 2015 to 2018 the song has been played at multiple live shows by both XCX and Sophie. &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Track Credits &&&&& Track Credits Adapted from Tidal &&&&& &&&&& Personnel: &&&&& &&&&& Written By: Charlotte Aitchison & Samuel Long &&&&& &&&&& Produced By: SOPHIE (Sophie Xeon) &&&&& &&&&& Co-Produced By: StarGate (Mikkel Storleer Eriksen & Tor Erik Hermansen) &&&&& &&&&& Composed By: SOPHIE & StarGate &&&&& &&&&& Mixed By: Michael Freeman & Mark "Spike" Stent &&&&& &&&&& Mastered By: Stuart Hawkes &&&&& &&&&& Vocals: Charli XCX &&&&& &&&&& Lyrics: © Warner/Chappell Music, Inc. &&&&& &&&&& Label: Warner Music Group, Atlantic Records UK & Asylum Records UK &&&&& &&&&& Release Date: July 27, 2018 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

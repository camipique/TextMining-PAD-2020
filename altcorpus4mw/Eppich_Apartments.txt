Eppich Apartments &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Eppich Apartments''' is an apartment building in Denver, Colorado. The American Craftsman building was designed by Walter Rice, a Denver architect and built by Louis F. Eppich, a Denver real-estate developer. The towers and parapets reflect a medieval influence. The second-floor balconies at the front of the house have oriental elements of design in the intricate frame with butterfly beams. There are also Spanish Colonial design elements in the corbeled pylon and terra-cotta drain pipe. It was built facing the view of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado State Capitol building, which now also includes Denver's high-rise buildings. Eppich owned the building until 1953. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 5, 1984. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

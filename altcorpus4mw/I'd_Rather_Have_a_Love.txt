I'd Rather Have a Love &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Rather Have a Love'''" is a song by American R&B singer Joe. It was written by Gerald Isaac, Derek "D.O.A." Allen, and Alvin Garrett for his tenth studio album ''Doubleback: Evolution of R&B'' (2013), while production was overseen by Allen. Released as the album's lead single, it peaked at number five on the US ''Billboard'' Adult R&B Songs chart. &&&&& &&&&& Commenting on its release, Joe stated, that it "certainly represents my style and flavor ... It has that really romantic element to it. It also speaks a lot of guys in a relationship that have a good thing going on but sometimes you know how we are. We forget what we have and we treat things a little differently. This is just a reminder basically, “I’d rather have love than nothing at all”. Who wants to be alone? It’s a great song." &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2013) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

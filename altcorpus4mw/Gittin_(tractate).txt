137	Gittin_(tractate)
Gittin (tractate) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Gittin''' (Hebrew: ) is a tractate of the Mishnah and the Talmud, and is part of the order of Nashim. The content of the tractate primarily deals with the legal provisions related to halakhic divorce, in particular, the laws relating to the ''Get'' (divorce document), although the tractate contains a number of other social provisions which are only vaguely related to that subject, but which offer numerous historical references related to the time of the Jewish uprising. The laws of the divorce itself, including when a divorce is permitted or even required, are discussed in other tractates, namely Ketubot. &&&&& &&&&& The word ''get'' (Hebrew: ) is thought to be an Akkadian word and generally refers to a written document. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& * Get (divorce document) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * The William Davidson Edition of the Talmud on Sefaria &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

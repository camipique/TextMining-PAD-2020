Indian Airlines Flight 423 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& On 29 September 1981, an Indian Airlines Boeing 737 IC423 flight from Srinagar to Delhi was hijacked by Sikh extremists to get appropriate rights from India and taken to Lahore, Pakistan. The plane had 111 passengers and 6 crew members on board. Five Sikh separatists of Dal Khalsa armed with knives had hijacked the plane. Dal Khalsa had been demanding a separate Sikh homeland of Khalistan. The aircraft on its way to New Delhi was rerouted to Lahore. The leader of the hijackers, Gajender, Singh talked to Natwar Singh, India’s ambassador in Pakistan and put forward his demands. &&&&& &&&&& Singh had demanded the release of his leaders, including Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and a sum of $500,000 in cash. &&&&& &&&&& Pakistan agreed to India’s request to ensure the passenger’s safety. Pakistan took commando action using its elite SSG which cleared the plane and got all passengers released. The hijackers faced trial in Pakistan and they were sentenced to Life imprisonment. &&&&& &&&&& The accused, Satnam Singh, after completing his trial, returned to India and was put on retrial. However the court discharged him, stating that the accused has already served the sentence in Pakistan. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

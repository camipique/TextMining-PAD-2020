Impossible (Kanye West song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Impossible'''" is a song by American hip-hop recording artist Kanye West, featuring Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ. The song was not featured on West's albums ''Late Registration'' (2005) and ''Graduation'' (2007) that were released around the same time as it, but was featured on the Mission: Impossible III soundtrack. The track was actually used as the official theme song for this film. It charted on the US ''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and Bubbling Under Hot 100 in 2006. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Along with the rest of the soundtrack for Mission: Impossible III, "Impossible" was recorded over the course of eight days at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. Franchise star Tom Cruise was delighted at West contributing to the soundtrack, describing himself as being "a fan of Kanye's work". &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& Vocals from "It's Impossible" by New Birth are sampled throughout the track. West didn't contribute to the production whatsoever, since the song was solely produced by Michael Giacchino, who composed all of the soundtrack for the movie. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& "Impossible" was placed on a list of '20 Horrible Songs Made By Great Rappers' that Al Shipley of ''Complex'' published in 2013. Jonathan Ringen of ''Rolling Stone'' rated the song two out of five stars and elaborated by writing: "It doesn't quite work: The skittering beat never settles into a groove, and the rhymes never explain what, exactly, is supposed to be so impossible." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& '''CD single''' &&&&& # "Impossible" (Radio) – 3:23 &&&&& # "Impossible" (Extended Radio) – 5:12 &&&&& # "Impossible" (Instrumental) – 5:09 &&&&& &&&&& '''12" single''' &&&&& ;A-side &&&&& #"Impossible" (Radio) - 3:25 &&&&& #"Impossible" (Extended Version) - 3:25 &&&&& ;B-side &&&&& #"Impossible" (Instrumental) - 5:09 &&&&& #"Drive Slow" (feat.

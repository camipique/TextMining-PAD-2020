198	Dfinity
Dfinity &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Dfinity''' is a blockchain-based cloud computing project. Its aim is to develop a decentralized "internet computer that will become the cloud 3.0." It is registered as a non-profit foundation in Zug, Switzerland, and operates research centers in Palo Alto, California and in Germany. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Dfinity raised $61 million from Andreesen Horowitz and Polychain Capital in a February 2018 funding round. At the time, Dfinity said it wanted to create an "internet computer" to cut the costs of running cloud-based business applications. A further $102 million funding round in August 2018 brought the project's total funding to $195 million. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2018, Dfinity announced plans to distribute around $35 million worth of Dfinity tokens in an airdrop. It was part of the company's plan to create a "Cloud 3.0." Because of regulatory concerns, none of the tokens went to US residents. &&&&& &&&&& Project &&&&& Dfinity aims to reduce the costs of cloud services by creating a decentralized "internet computer" which may launch in 2018 or early 2019. &&&&& &&&&& Dfinity claims transactions on its network are finalized in 3â€“5 seconds, compared to 1 hour for Bitcoin and 10 minutes for Ethereum. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

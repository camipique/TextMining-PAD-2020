Their escort was the small ship of the line . &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& On the morning of 4 August they encountered French squadron consisting of the frigates ''Concorde'', ''Médée'', and ''Franchise''. The French commander was concerned that he had encountered a fleet of powerful warships so he turned to escape. The British commander, Captain Rowley Bulteel, immediately ordered a pursuit. To preserve the impression of warships he also ordered four of his most powerful East Indiamen to join the chase. First ''Belliqueux'' captured ''Concorde''. ''Exeter'' and ''Bombay Castle'' set out after ''Médée'' and succeeded in coming up with her after dark and tricking her into surrendering to what ''Médée'' thought was a ship of the line. &&&&& &&&&& ''Dorsetshire'' reached Rio de Janeiro on 12 August and arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 21 February 1801. &&&&& &&&&& Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 7 May Second Bar.

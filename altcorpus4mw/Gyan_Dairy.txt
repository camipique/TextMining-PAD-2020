Milk and Food Products and was founded by Mr. C.P. Agarwal in 2007. Since its inception, Gyan Dairy has been led by brothers and joint managing directors, Mr. Jai Agarwal and Mr. Anuj Agarwal. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In 2005, Mr. C.P. Agarwal, who was leading C.P. Milk and Food Products, bought over a small dairy unit along with its brand name 'Gyan'. This small dairy unit was refurbished to create Gyan Dairy, which is now the largest dairy manufacturer in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. A subsidiary of C.P. Milk and Food Products, Gyan Dairy was founded in 2007 after a cooperative system of dairy farming was set up by the company, in the villages of Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Since its inception, Gyan Dairy which is headquartered in Lucknow, is being jointly managed by Mr. C.P. Agarwal's grandsons Mr. Jai Agarwal and Mr. Anuj Agarwal. &&&&& &&&&& Products &&&&& Gyan Dairy started with just two products on its portfolio â€“ Gyan Skimmed Milk Powder and Gyan Desi Ghee.

Before the company began manufacturing, they created a cooperative system of dairy farming, starting with their home district of Farrukhabad. A team was set up for expanding their village base and Gyan Dairy has since grown significantly. The cooperative system that has been set up by Gyan Dairy, encourages farmers to take up dairy farming. Now, Gyan Diary has 1700 village level collection centers, and collects about a million liters of milk every day from 65,000 farmers spread across 6 districts in Uttar Pradesh and districts adjoining Lucknow. Gyan Dairy has taken a low milk productivity belt and transformed it into high milk producing one. &&&&& &&&&& Achievements &&&&& &&&&& * Gyan Dairy is an ISO 22000-2005 certified company and has received a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) Monitoring System Certification from the Government of India. &&&&& * Mr. Jai Agarwal and Mr. Anuj Agarwal, the joint managing directors of Gyan Dairy, have received the Young Indian Entrepreneur of the year awards in the year 2016. &&&&& &&&&& Partnerships &&&&& Gyan Dairy is the official dairy partner for the UP Yoddha which is Uttar Pradesh's official kabaddi team for the VIVO PKL 2017 tournament.

High on You (song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''High On You'''" is a 1985 song by the American rock band Survivor. It peaked at No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 the week of March 23, 1985. It also reached No. 8 on the Top Rock Tracks chart. It was the band's second single and first top-ten hit from their 1984 album ''Vital Signs''. &&&&& &&&&& "High On You" was one of Frankie and Peterik compositions. "This is one song that's not brain surgery. It came from a jam. A lot of great songs come from jam sessions. I remember soundchecks with Survivor and The Ides Of March, and there's no better place to start a jam then on stage. Everything is miked-up, you're in a good mood, the lights come on, the audience isn't there yet and you start jamming. "High on You" was similar to that, only it started in rehearsal. Frankie started jamming on this really great guitar riff. I started laying my right hand on the keyboard and coming up with that very sing-song melody." &&&&& &&&&& Jim Peterik told to songfacts: "Lyrically, I've had that title ever since the CBS convention in 1977 when Sly Stone of Sly & the Family Stone - there were rumors about him being strung out on drugs - he bolts on stage all cleaned up and says, 'I want you to know, people, I am high on you." Everybody applauded. There's a title if I ever heard one, so I guess indirectly he inspired that song." &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (1985) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Top Rock Tracks &&&&& &&&&& 8 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

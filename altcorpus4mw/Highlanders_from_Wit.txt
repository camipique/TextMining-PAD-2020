It's good that it did not last long - two or three days". &&&&& &&&&& The former editor-in-chief of the newspaper "Chernovik" Nadira Isayeva wrote a: "Look at the" humorous "videos of a group of former Dagestani KVN boxers "Mountaineers of mind" on YouTube. They represent the Dagestanians as idiots with a single convolutions in their heads and an unregulated Russian speech. The videos have hundreds of thousands, even millions of views. "Mountaineers of mind" seemed to have conspired with the site "Kavkazpress" in the global virtual space to form their opinion about the kinsmen as morons. Only if "Kavkazpress" is a federal publication under the control of the special services of Russia, "Mountaineers of mind" is a product of local "cultural figures". In fact, people who make a laughingstock of their people are generally considered to be national traitors". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Official community on VKontakte &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

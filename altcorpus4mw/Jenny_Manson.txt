Jenny Manson &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jenny Rachel Manson''' (née '''Salaman'''; born November 1948) is a British activist, author, former civil servant, former Labour Party councillor for Colindale on Barnet London Borough Council, and Chair of Jewish Voice for Labour. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Manson was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire where, according to Manson, her family was the only Jewish family "and the only family that voted Labour". Her parents were Labour Party supporters and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) activists. &&&&& &&&&& Her father, Raphael Arthur Salaman (1906–1993) was an engineer and lexicographer of craftsmen's hand-tools who got news from Amnesty and CND delivered, and would read the Bible to Manson. Her mother, Miriam Polianowsky (1914–2013), escaped a pogrom in 1917 and left Ukraine for Palestine where she lived in Haifa for 10 years before coming to England at the age of 15 and lived in Hampstead Garden Suburb. &&&&& &&&&& In 1969, at the age of 20, Manson graduated with a degree in History from the University of Oxford where she studied at Somerville College. &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& Manson's family celebrated Passover and observed Yom Kippur, and her father's family were members of Bevis Marks. Her paternal grandmother Nina Ruth Davis (1877–1925) was a Hebrew Hebraist and poet. Her paternal grandmother's parents were Arthur Davis and Louisa Jonas. Arthur Davis' family were precision instrument makers who had lived in England since the early 19th century. &&&&& &&&&& Manson's paternal grandfather was botanist and potato breeder Dr Redcliffe Nathan Salaman FRS (1874–1955) who wrote ''The History and Social Influence of the Potato''. Redcliffe's parents, Sarah Solomon (1844–1931) and Myer Salaman (1836–1896), were merchants who traded in ostrich feathers during the height of the plume trade. The Salaman family are Ashkenazi Jews, who according to Manson's paternal grandfather, migrated to Britain from Holland or the Rhineland in the early 18th century. &&&&& &&&&& Manson's maternal aunt is writer Esther Salaman (née Polianowski) and her paternal aunt is singer Esther Salaman. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& At the age of 21, Manson joined the Inland Revenue where she worked as a tax inspector, retiring from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in November 2011. She then worked in her husband's publishing company for two years, before retiring completely in 2014. &&&&& &&&&& Manson is now a trustee of two local charities and chairs Barnet Carers Centre. She was a governor of the Garden Suburb School and chair in North London of the Save the Children charity. &&&&& &&&&& After leaving university, she wrote a book of essays about consciousness, ''What It Feels Like to Be Me'', which was published in 2010. This led to Manson being invited by the Association of Jewish Refugees to talk to Holocaust survivors. She edited the 2012 book ''Public Service on the Brink'' about the dangers of managerialism from her period of being employed by HMRC. &&&&& &&&&& Labour Party &&&&& At the age of 16, Manson joined the Young Socialists and has been a member of the Labour Party since 1969. In May 1986, in the Barnet London Borough Council election, she was elected councillor in Colindale until 1990. In June 1987, she stood as a parliamentary candidate in Hendon North in the UK general election. She was inspired to become politically active again after Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party in 2015. Manson is a General Committee member of Finchley and Golders Green Constituency Labour Party. &&&&& &&&&& In July 2017, Manson was elected chair of Jewish Voice for Labour. She has stated that the organisation's mission is to contribute to making the Labour party an open, democratic and inclusive party, encouraging all ethnic groups and cultures to join and participate freely." &&&&& &&&&& Views &&&&& Manson identifies as anti-racist and as a secular Jew. She cites her family connection to Israel as influencing her views on Israel and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In June 2018, she told the ''Jewish Chronicle'' "my views on Israel and Palestine have moved quite a lot in the last 20 or 30 years, like many people I suppose." She has visited Israel twice. In 1966, she visited Israel during her gap year where she stayed with her cousins on a kibbutz. She said about the visit, "I was shocked then by the way Arabs were talked about in Israel. I was most happy on the kibbutz because they had dialogue with Palestinians. I remember them coming in for secret conversations in the night" and that she felt "desperately frightened" for Israel during the Six-Day War. She said, "I don't think as a family we discussed or questioned Zionism. It had sort of just happened." In 2001, she joined Jews for Justice for Palestinians, and in 2016, she visited Israel for the second time with Yachad and "met with groups like Breaking the Silence and got a worrying impression from them that they were fearing for their security from other Jews for speaking up against the current situation." In April 2018, ''The Jewish Chronicle'' quoted that Manson "began to identify as a Jew in order to argue against the state of Israel and its conduct..." She later clarified, "I was saying that in the context of Jewish political activity I only identified with Jewish organisations as my concerns about Israel's activities grew intense..." &&&&& &&&&& In August 2017, Manson said that Jewish Voice for Labour would "provide a much-needed forum for Jews who want to celebrate and debate the long and proud history of Jewish involvement in socialist and trade-union activism." She added that they "invite everyone of Jewish heritage in the Labour Party to join us in continuing these great traditions." In September, she clarified that the organisation is "not anti-Zionist" but stated that it was "an alternative voice for Jewish members of Labour" who do not support the Jewish Labour Movement's "profoundly Zionist orientation". In October, she added that the organisation was set up because "Jewish members of the Labour Party have been unrepresented in recent years" so it could "become the voice of Jewish Labour Party members and we will be able to say what we think about issues like racism, free speech and Israel-Palestine." &&&&& &&&&& In March 2018, Manson said on BBC's ''Daily Politics'' that Jeremy Corbyn had taken "enormously strong action" to deal with antisemitism in the Labour Party. In April, Manson said on BBC Radio 4's ''Today programme'', referring to a survey conducted by Campaign Against Antisemitism: "Evidence including very recent evidence commissioned by a Jewish body suggests the very worst antisemitism is still on the right, on the far right and always has been." &&&&& &&&&& In July 2018, Manson was criticised for comparing the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism with Section 28. She subsequently apologised for her "clumsy" analogy, which she claimed had been "misunderstood" by clarifying that she was "making a speech on the impact IHRA has in shutting down discussion" and "making the point that section 28 was a policy which acted as a deterrent, without there ever being a case where it was enacted." &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In 1969, after graduating from university, Manson moved to London and married Michael Manson, a medical and veterinary book publisher. They have lived in the same house in Hampstead Garden Suburb since 1973 and have two daughters, Jessica and Lydia, who both attended the Garden Suburb School. &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Title &&&&& &&&&& Credit &&&&& &&&&& Publisher &&&&& &&&&& ISBN &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2010 &&&&& &&&&& ''What It Feels Like to Be Me'' &&&&& &&&&& Author &&&&& &&&&& Psyche Books &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2012 &&&&& &&&&& ''Public Service on the Brink'' &&&&& &&&&& Editor &&&&& &&&&& Imprint Academic &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *British Jews &&&&& *List of British Jewish writers &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Jewish Voice for Labour website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Diagonal Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Diagonal Community School District''' is a K-12 school district headquartered in Diagonal, Iowa. The district, in Ringgold County, serves Diagonal. &&&&& &&&&& All grade levels and the administration share the same building. it had the lowest enrollment of any Iowa school district: 97; the 12th grade class that year had nine students. Due to the difficult financial situation, the district uses cost-cutting measures such as using dry-erase desktops instead of paper and using the same paint color for all rooms. Diagonal CSD does not have enough funds to provide elective courses at the senior high school level, so its high school students take those courses at Mount Ayr High School in Mount Ayr. &&&&& &&&&& When the Clearfield Community School District closed on July 1, 2014, the Diagonal district absorbed a portion of it. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Diagonal Community School District &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

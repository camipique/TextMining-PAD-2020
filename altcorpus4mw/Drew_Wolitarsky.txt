Drew Wolitarsky &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Drew William Wolitarsky''' (born March 22, 1995) is a professional Canadian football wide receiver for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Wolitarksy's father spent time in Montreal where he met his son's mother. Due to his mother's Canadian citizenship, Wolitarsky pursued his own citizenship for Canada, becoming one shortly before the 2017 CFL draft. Following his time with the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Wolitarsky failed to get drafted or any offers from the NFL. His brother Austin encouraged him to give the CFL a try and he was drafted by the Blue Bombers who were interested in his status as a non-import receiver. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Leo Barjesteh &&&&& Introduction &&&&& ''' Leonardus Alexander Ferydoun "Leo" Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn''' (Rotterdam, 18 October 1962) is a Dutch-Persian historian, publisher and museum director. &&&&& &&&&& In 1988 Barjesteh established himself as an independent publisher, specialising in history, culture and genealogy. He is also co-founder (2000) and since 2017 president of the International Qajar Studies Association and has been editor-in-chief of its journal (Qajar Studies) since the first issue in 2000. &&&&& &&&&& Genealogical projects &&&&& In 2007 together with Frans Plooij and Toon van Gestel he initiated the first large-scale genetic genealogy project in the Netherlands, the Project Genetische Genealogie in Nederland. Over the years the project had 1,500 participants. The project focussed on the Y-chromosomal DNA and at that time was unique as it combined genetic profiles with pedigree lines going back centuries. The first combined DNA-results and genealogies were published in Zonen van Adam in Nederland in 2008. &&&&& &&&&& The publication of the book Honderd Schiedamse Families in 2010 lead to an accompanying exhibition: Rijkdom van de stad. The exhibition inspired the foundation of a museum for family history. &&&&& After purchasing an old monastery in Eijsden, Limburg, Barjesteh in 2013 founded the International Museum for Family History in the Ursulinenconvent. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

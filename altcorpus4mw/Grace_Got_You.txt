A lyric video was released on December 20, 2017. In an interview with FreeCCM, lead vocalist Bart Millard revealed the meaning behind the song,"'Grace Got You’ is just a song that makes me smile. The whole idea that once you realize that God’s grace has you… no matter what comes your way, you can live your life as if you’ve already read the last page of the book and know how the whole thing turns out. Our eternity is set! On your worst day, Christ is OK with you. He adores you. He’s pleased with you. How is that possible? No clue, but it is. That’s the most amazing news of all! When we originally made the album, we wanted to have someone rap, but we didn’t know who we were going to get. Our paths crossed with a guy who used to be on Gotee Records named John Reuben – who we had done stuff early on with when we were all new together – and we asked him if he’d come out of retirement to rap on the song. It turned out so fun, and totally matched the vibe of the song." &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& ;CD release &&&&& # "Grace Got You" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (High Key with Background Vocals)" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (High Key without Background Vocals)" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (Medium Key with Background Vocals)" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (Medium Key without Background Vocals)" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (Low Key with Background Vocals)" &&&&& # "Grace Got You (Low Key without Background Vocals)" &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& Credits taken from AllMusic. &&&&& &&&&& '''MercyMe''' &&&&& * Bart Millard – lead vocals &&&&& * Nathan Cochran – bass guitar &&&&& * Barry Graul – guitar &&&&& * Mike Scheuchzer – guitar &&&&& * Robby Shaffer – drums &&&&& &&&&& Charts &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Weekly charts=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peak position &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Christian AC (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Christian AC Indicator (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 1 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Year-end charts=== &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Chart (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Peakposition &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Christian Airplay (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 2 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& US Christian Songs (''Billboard'') &&&&& &&&&& 6 &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

J. A. Green (photographer) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jonathan Adagogo Green''' (1873-1905) was a “Nigeria's first indigenous professional photographer”. He is significant in being the pioneering Nigerian photographer, noted for his documentation of the colonial power and local culture, particularly his Ibani Ijo community. &&&&& &&&&& Green was born in Bonny, present day Rivers State. “He studied photography in Sierra Leone and then established a studio in Bonny.” He was active as a photographer for only a short lifetime, dying at the age of 32. &&&&& “But during this period he was both energetically productive and remarkably adroit in serving both indigenous and colonial clienteles.” &&&&& “When he set up shop his work was appreciated and rewarded by two very different communities.” His "strategic use of initials on his business cards and stamps... disguised his African origins", part of his working with the colonial era officials. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Relevant literature &&&&& Anderson, Martha G. and Lisa Aronson, eds. 2017.

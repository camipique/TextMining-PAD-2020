Giant Little Ones &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Giant Little Ones''''' is a 2018 Canadian drama film, directed by Keith Behrman. The film stars Kyle MacLachlan and Maria Bello as the parents of a teenage boy (Josh Wiggins), whose lives are upended after their son and a friend are involved in an incident at a party. &&&&& &&&&& The film was shot in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario in 2017. &&&&& &&&&& It premiered on September 9, 2018 at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival and later received a limited release in the United States on March 1, 2019. &&&&& &&&&& In December 2018, the Toronto International Film Festival named the film to its annual year-end Canada's Top Ten list. Behrman won the Vancouver Film Critics Circle award for Best Screenplay for a Canadian Film. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Ray Winter (Kyle MacLachlan) leaves his wife, Carly (Maria Bello), for another man. Ray's popular, athletic son, Franky (Josh Wiggins), refuses to talk to his father despite Ray's pleas. &&&&& &&&&& The film begins some time later, as Franky is about to celebrate a birthday. His best friend, fellow swimmer Ballas Kohl (Darren Mann), pressures Franky to sleep with girlfriend Priscilla (Hailey Kittle) just as Ballas and his girlfriend, Jess (Kiandra Madeira), have done. (Ballas boasts of having had sex repeatedly.) After Franky's birthday party, a partly-drunk Ballas attempts a homosexual act with an equally intoxicated Franky. Ballas is terrified that his actions have outed him, and he and his girlfriend begin to spread rumors that it is Franky who initiated the sex. When several members of the high school swim team bully Michael (Carson MacCormac), Franky stands up to his teammates and defends the shy, skinny boy—reinforcing the belief by most kids at the school that Franky is gay. &&&&& &&&&& Franky begins to piece his life back together by befriending potentially transgender friend Mouse (Niamh Wilson). He also rekindles his friendship with Ballas' sister, Natasha (Taylor Hickson), whom everyone (including Franky) ostracized some time ago as a "slut" after she had sex with another boy. Franky finds himself romantically involved with Natasha. Franky realizes that being pushed into a straight relationship is just as bad as being bullied for being gay, and that he should put off a serious relationship or sex until he's ready. The insight helps Franky come to terms with his father's homosexuality. &&&&& &&&&& Critical response &&&&& ''Giant Little Ones'' received positive reviews. On the website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% approval rating, based on 46 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "''Giant Little Ones'' puts a complex and refreshingly nuanced spin on the traditional coming of age drama, further elevated by the admirable efforts of a talented cast." Writing for CBC Arts in his regular Queeries column on LGBTQ entertainment, Peter Knegt praised the film as part of a rising and necessary trend of honest depictions of teenage sexuality and sexual identity issues. He wrote that the film "feels like something of an antidote to last year's gay teen rom-com ''Love, Simon'', which felt like it barely scratched the surface of what its characters were going through." &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& The cast includes: &&&&& *Josh Wiggins as Franky Winter &&&&& *Darren Mann as Ballas Kohl, Franky's lifelong best friend &&&&& *Taylor Hickson as Natasha Kohl, Ballas' younger sister &&&&& *Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Winter, Franky's father &&&&& *Maria Bello as Carly Winter, Franky's mother &&&&& *Hailey Kittle as Priscilla, Franky's girlfriend &&&&& *Kiandra Madeira as Jess, Ballas' girlfriend &&&&& *Carson MacCormac as Michael, a bullied boy &&&&& *Niamh Wilson as Mouse, Franky's female friend (who may or may not be transgender) &&&&& *Olivia Scriven as Deanne, Franky’s sister &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& ;Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ;Citations &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

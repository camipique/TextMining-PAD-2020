God the Father with Two Saints &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& thumb &&&&& '''''God the Father with Two Saints''''' is a 1477â€“78 fresco by Perugino. It was painted for the church of San Francesco in Deruta and shows the town at its base, along with the inscription "DECRETO PUBBLICO DFCTA / ANNO DOMINI MCCCCLXXVII/III". This shows it was an ex voto for the end of the plague in 1476 - the two saints are St Roch (right) and St Romanus (left), both invoked against the plague. &&&&& &&&&& It comes from the painter's initial period back in Umbria after returning following his training under Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. It reuses elements from his previous work - St Roch's head is similar to that of Balthazar in ''Adoration of the Magi'', whilst the pavement pattern is from ''The Miracle of the Stillborn Child''. &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& &&&&& *Vittoria Garibaldi, Perugino, in ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Florence, 2004 () &&&&& &&&&&

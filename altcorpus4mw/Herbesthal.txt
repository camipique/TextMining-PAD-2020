The place is first mentioned in the State Archives of Liège under the name "Hardwestal" (14041405). Various sources refer the name to the following meanings: "Hostel in the valley", "Herbes Valley", "Herbert's place of residence" (the word "stal" in Germanic means residence) or even "Eggental" (the harrow is an agricultural implement). When the village was under French rule (1794-1814), it was called "Aubergeval", which can be translated as "hostel in the valley". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

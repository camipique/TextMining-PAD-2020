John Margolies &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''John Margolies''' was an architectural critic, photographer, and author who was noted for celebrating vernacular and novelty architecture in the United States, particularly those designed as roadside attractions. Starting from the mid-1970s, he began to photograph sites during long road trips, since he was concerned these sites would be displaced by the growing modernist trend. He was credited with shaping postmodern architecture and recognizing buildings that would be added to the National Register of Historic Places through his documentary work. Starting in 2007, the Library of Congress began to acquire his photographs, and created the public domain John Margolies Roadside America Photograph Archive in 2016, consisting of 11,710 scans of color slides taken by Margolies. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& John Samuel Margolies was born on in New Canaan, Connecticut, the son of Asher and Ethel (n√©e Polacheck). During childhood road trips, he would beg his parents to stop at roadside attractions, but they refused, believing it to be "the ugliest stuff in the world." Margolies studied at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in art history and journalism, and a master's degree in communications. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& After graduating, Margolies took a job at ''Architectural Record'' and worked as the program director of the Architectural League of New York, where he exhibited the work of Morris Lapidus in 1970. Lapidus was famed for designing the Eden Roc hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, and the exhibition horrified Margolies's peers. He began to photograph novelty architecture in the mid-70s, concerned that these sights were starting to disappear. Margolies was funded through grants and fellowships through the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Alicia Patterson Foundation, and architect Philip Johnson. &&&&& &&&&& Margolies exhibited his photographs at the Hudson River Museum in 1981, a show described by critic Paul Goldberger as "pure joy" and "an articulate plea against the homogenization of the American landscape." The Library of Congress credits Margolies with shaping the postmodernist movement, and digitized his work in 2016, making it available as public domain. &&&&& &&&&& The photographs distinctively omit people and are taken in full sunlight with clear skies, a deliberate choice to reduce visual distraction. &&&&& &&&&& Other interests &&&&& Margolies was also a noted collector of postcards, maps, and other travel ephemera. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& File:The Whale Car Wash, Oklahoma City.jpg|The Whale Car Wash, Oklahoma City (1979) &&&&& File:China Garden Cafe sign, Cedar City, Utah.jpg|China Garden Cafe sign, Cedar City, Utah (1987) &&&&& File:Bomber Gas Station.jpg|Bomber Gas Station, Milwaukie, Oregon (1980) &&&&& File:Benewah Dairy milk bottle 1, Cedar Street, Spokane, Washington (Margolies).jpg|Beneway Dairy Milk Bottle #1, Cedar Street, Spokane, Washington (1980) &&&&& File:Campus Drive-In Theater, closer view with neon, El Cajon Boulevard, San Diego, California.jpg|Campus Drive-In Theater, El Cajon Boulevard, San Diego, California (1979) &&&&& File:The Ship Restaurant, Route 1, Saugus, Massachusetts.jpg|The Ship Restaurant, Route 1, Saugus, Massachusetts (1984) &&&&& File:Modern Diner, diagonal front detail, Dexter Avenue, Pawtucket, Rhode Island LOC 24895037808.jpg|Modern Diner, diagonal front detail, Dexter Avenue, Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1978) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

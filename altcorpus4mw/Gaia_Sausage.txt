274	Gaia_Sausage
Gaia Sausage &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Gaia Sausage''' is the remains of a dwarf galaxy, the "Sausage Galaxy" or '''Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage''' or just '''Gaia-Enceladus''', that merged with the Milky Way about 8 - 11 billion years ago. At least eight globular clusters were added to the Milky Way along with 50 billion solar masses of stars, gas and dark matter. The "Gaia Sausage" is so-called because of the characteristic sausage shape of the population in velocity space, the appearance on a plot of radial versus azimuthal and vertical velocities of stars measured in the Gaia Mission. The stars that have merged with the Milky Way have orbits that are highly radial. The outermost points of their orbits are around 20 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre at what is called the halo break. &&&&& &&&&& Components &&&&& The Sausage globular clusters are NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 2298, NGC 2808 (possibly the old galactic core), NGC 5286, NGC 6864, NGC 6779, and NGC 7089. &&&&& &&&&& The stars from this dwarf have eccentricities of about 0.9. Their metallicity is also typically higher than other halo stars, with many with Fe/H over -1.7 dex. &&&&& &&&&& The ‘Gaia Sausage’ reconstructed the Milky Way, by puffing up the thin disk to make it a thick disk, whilst the gas it brought into the Milky Way triggered a fresh round of star formation and replenished the thin disk. The debris from the dwarf galaxy provides most of the metal-rich halo. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& * Field of Streams &&&&& * Monoceros Ring &&&&& * Omega Centauri &&&&& * M32p, large galaxy merged into Andromeda Galaxy, responsible for its thick disc and most halo stars &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

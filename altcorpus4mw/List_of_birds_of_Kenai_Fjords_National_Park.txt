List of birds of Kenai Fjords National Park &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& This is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species recorded in Kenai Fjords National Park, which is in the U.S. state of Alaska. Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS) in March 2018. Most of the waters adjacent to the Park are not actually part of it even when (as in the fjords), the water is almost entirely surrounded by Park land. Species recorded in waters near the park are also included here. &&&&& &&&&& This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the ''Check-list of North American Birds'', 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the ''Check-list''. &&&&& This list contains 227 species. The following codes and definitions are used by the NPS to annotate some of them. The others are residents and regular migrants which a visitor can expect to see at least monthly in the proper season and habitat. &&&&& &&&&& *(PP) = '''Probably present''' - "High confidence species occurs in park but current, verified evidence needed" (17 species) &&&&& *(Unc) = '''Unconfirmed''' - "Species is attributed to park but evidence is weak or absent" (37 species) &&&&& *(Adj) = '''Adjacent''' - "Species is known to occur in areas near to or contiguous with park boundaries" (31 species) &&&&& *(R) = '''Rare''' - "Present, but usually seen only a few times each year" (27 species) &&&&& *(O) = '''Occasional''' - "Occurs in the park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year" (13 species) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ducks, geese, and waterfowl &&&&& Canada goose &&&&& '''Order''': Anseriformes'''Family''': Anatidae &&&&& &&&&& The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Introduction to Adventure Gaming &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''''Introduction to Adventure Gaming''''' is a 1981 game booklet published by Simulations Publications, Inc. &&&&& &&&&& Contents &&&&& ''Introduction to Adventure Gaming'' is a booklet with three introductory games: ''The Creatures that Ate New York'', in which each player randomly picks a monster and a mission; ''Napoleon at Waterloo'', the famous battle of Waterloo, pitting Napoleon's troops against the forces of Wellington and Blucher; and ''The Tower of Azann'', in which a wizardly warrior must enter the Tower and come out with a kidnapped child. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& W. G. Armintrout reviewed ''Introduction to Adventure Gaming'' in ''The Space Gamer'' No. 50. Armintrout commented that "What good is an introductory game that is all introductory and no game? ''Tower'' is enough to discourage any novice fantasy gamer, while ''Creatures'' is hardly an endorsement for science fiction gaming. Only ''Napoleon at Waterloo'' is both a decent game and an introduction to gaming. I should also warn you that the 'History of Gaming' and the 'Hints on Play' promised on the cover aren't to be found inside the booklet! Even so, one of the three games here is perfect for the purpose." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

144	Lessemsauridae
Lessemsauridae &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Lessemsauridae''' is a clade of early sauropod dinosaurs that lived in the Triassic and Jurassic of Argentina and South Africa. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Apaldetti and colleagues in 2018 recovered a new clade of Sauropodiformes uniting ''Lessemsaurus'', ''Antetonitrus'', and the recently described ''Ingentia'' which they named Lessemsauridae. Lessemsaurids had highly pneumatic cervical and dorsal vertebrae, very antero-posteriorly short but tall cervical vertebrae, robust cervicals, a very expanded distal scapula blade, and upright arms. Depending on the definition of Sauropoda, the clade is either the oldest sauropod taxon, or the sister taxon of the clade. An additional member of the clade was named later in 2018, ''Ledumahadi''. Lessemsaurids are recognised as very large quadrupeds that achieved giant sizes (up to 12 metric tons) independently of other giant sauropods. The phylogenetic analysis performed by Apaldetti and colleagues is shown below: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

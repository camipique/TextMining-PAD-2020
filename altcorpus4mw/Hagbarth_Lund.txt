He practiced as a prosecutor in Tana Municipality from 1907 to 1922. During that time he also served several other roles. He was the mayor of Tana Municipality from 1908 to 1916, having run for the Liberal Party. From 1910 to 1914 he was a member of Finnmark County Committee. In 1913, he was elected to the Storting (Norwegian Parliament), representing Finnmark county, a seat he held until 1924.  &&&&& &&&&& In 1922, he was appointed to be the County Governor of Finnmark county, so he left parliament and a deputy filled in for the rest of his term which ended in 1924. From 1925 to 1930 he was elected as a deputy representative to Parliament representing the Market towns of Nordland, Troms and Finnmark, meaning he only served in Parliament if the representative was unable.

From 1942 to 1945 while Lund was not governor, Iver Leuch Elieson was the German-occupation government's governor of Vest-Agder. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

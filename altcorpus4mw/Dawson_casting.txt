Dawson casting &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Dawson casting''' is an observed cultural phenomenon and movie trope in film and television where many of the actors appear, and in reality are, much older than the characters they are portraying. The concept is observable in teen dramas such as ''Glee'', and ''Gossip Girl'', and ''Pretty Little Liars'' where grown adults are cast to play teenage characters. The term was originally circulated on the Internet in response to the casting choices in ''Dawson's Creek''. &&&&& &&&&& Social ramifications &&&&& It has been suggested on several occasions by critics that Dawson casting has several negative implications, specifically for adolescents. These commonly include accusations of unrealistic beauty standards, negative body image, low self-esteem, and general mental health problems, especially in regards to one's self-perception. &&&&& &&&&& A clinical psychologist, Barbara Greenberg, told ''Teen Vogue'' that casting twenty-year-old actors for the roles of high-school students can worsen the struggles of adolescents, stating "It can give the message that theyâ€™re supposed to look good all the time" adding "That leads to all kinds of body-image and social-comparison issues". &&&&& &&&&& In popular culture &&&&& *In an episode of ''Will & Grace'', Jack acknowledges the phenomenon when he exclaims "This is just like ''The O.C.'', except without 25-year-old teenagers and 35-year-old parents". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

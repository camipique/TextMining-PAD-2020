Poznanski stood unsuccessfully for the Honiara seat in the Legislative Council in 1967, and then resumed teaching at the Government Primary School in Honiara. In September 1969, she was elected to the Ngosi Ward of the Honiara Town Council. The following year she became Assistant Clerk to the Governing Council.

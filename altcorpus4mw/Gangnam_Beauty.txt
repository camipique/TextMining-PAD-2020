Based on the webtoon of the same name published in 2016 by Naver Webtoon, it centers on the life of a college student who went under cosmetic surgery to evade derision from her bullies yet her plan seems to backfire as her peers ridicule her artificial look. The title of the webtoon and of the TV series alludes to the Korean word ''gangnammi-in'' (''Gangnam beauty''), a derogatory term in South Korea for people who have had a lot of plastic surgeries. &&&&& &&&&& The series premiered on JTBC on July 27, 2018 and aired every Friday and Saturday at 23:00 (KST). It is one of the highest rated Korean dramas in cable television history. It also garnered praise for its portrayal of issues afflicting South Korean society, particularly on its superficial beauty standards and discrimination on the basis of physical appearance. &&&&& &&&&& Synopsis &&&&& Kang Mi-rae (Im Soo-hyang) decides to get plastic surgery after years of being bullied because of her looks. Her "rebirth" seems successful at first, but as her life at the university unfolds, her plan starts to backfire. The pressure of being a "pretty girl" begins to pressure her and, worse, those who can see through her surgery ridicule her and tag her as the "Gangnam plastic surgery monster." The drama follows Mi-rae's story of recovering self-esteem as she gets to know her coursemate, and former schoolmate in middle school, Do Kyung-seok (Cha Eun-woo). &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Introduction &&&&& Youth Growth Drama with Real Reviews on Plastic Surgery &&&&& &&&&& The International Society of Plastic Surgery (IASA) ranked fourth in the global plastic surgery world rankings. &&&&& &&&&& It ranks first in the number of single-person plastic surgery cases compared to the population and experiences 30 percent of female college students in Korea. &&&&& &&&&& Asia's leading plastic surgery exporting countries such as China, Vietnam and Thailand &&&&& &&&&& In Korea, plastic surgery has become a fairly universal process of beauty, nothing special. &&&&& &&&&& Given the daily appearance and criticism that overflows with the subway station's abundant plastic surgery ads, SNS and article comments, it also feels like society is encouraging. &&&&& &&&&& At the same time, however, negative social views on plastic surgery remain. &&&&& &&&&& You can't be ugly, you can't be beautiful if you have plastic surgery, so if you're pretty, you might be a flower snake. &&&&& &&&&& The drama is a drama about Korea's 2018 appearance-based reality, which easily criticizes women's looks and criticizes them. &&&&& &&&&& So the drama is not about a woman who succeeds in love through her gender. &&&&& &&&&& It's not a common fairy tale in which a transformed protagonist gets everything. &&&&& &&&&& Rather, the drama is a pleasant but serious portrayal of the heroine's agony, which has come to face with the reality that shows a lower level after her sexuality. &&&&& &&&&& And it's a story of young people growing up with their own pain in an appearance-oriented society. &&&&& &&&&& Cast &&&&& ===Main=== &&&&& * Im Soo-hyang as Kang Mi-rae &&&&& **Jeon Min-seo as young Kang Mi-rae &&&&& :A timid and insecure girl who has low self-esteem due to her "ugly" appearance.

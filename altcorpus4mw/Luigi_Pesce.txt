Luigi Pesce &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Luigi Pesce''' (1828 – 1864) was born in Naples, Italy and died in Tehran, Iran. Pesce was an Italian colonel and photographer who traveled to Iran during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. &&&&& &&&&& Photographing Iran &&&&& &&&&& The first photo collection of Iran's ancient monuments were captured by Luigi Pesce during his trip to Iran. &&&&& A second copy was also produced from the collection in the same year and was sent to Prince William I, King of Prussia. Another copy was donated to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contains 75 pieces of photos and is probably the same album that was sent to the Prussian King. &&&&& &&&&& The oldest pictures in this collection were taken between 1852 and 1855. &&&&& There are three photos of Naser al-Din Shah during his younger years and one group picture in the collection. Most of the images show the architecture of Iran during the 1800s. &&&&& The images hold a unique historical value and illustrate people's lives and that of the royal court. Although few women have been captured in the photos, it clearly documents various classes in Iran showing the existing social hierarchy in those days. &&&&& &&&&& Pesce's pictures that captured Iranian historic sites were shown at the World Harris Exhibition in 1867 and received an honorary award. &&&&& &&&&& Persepolis &&&&& Pesce is considered the first photographer to have captured images of Persepolis, Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam in 1858. He gave the photos as a gift to the young Naser al-Din Shah who took a liking to photography and paid other photographers to come to Iran and capture historical sites. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Jane Dieulafoy &&&&& *Pascal Coste &&&&& *Eugène Flandin &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * مجموعه لوئیجی پشه در تارنمای کتابخانه ملی فرانسه &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

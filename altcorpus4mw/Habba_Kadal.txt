134	Habba_Kadal
Habba Kadal &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Habba Kadal''' is a wooden bridge located in the old city of Srinagar, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that crosses the Jhelum river. It was first built in 1551 by Sultan Habib Shah of the Shah Miri Dynasty and is one of the seven original bridges that have existed in the city for a long time. It had to be rebuilt after the heavy floods of 1893. Although originally planned to be dismantled as the New Habba Kadal bridge made it redundant, the government, as part of its policy of preserving heritage, undertook renovation of the bridge. It was started in 2013 and took two years to complete. Finally, the bridge again opened to public in 2015. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *New Habba Kadal &&&&& *Amira Kadal &&&&& *Budshah Bridge &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

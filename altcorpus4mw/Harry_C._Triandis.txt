Harry C. Triandis &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Harry Charalambos Triandis''' (born in 1926) is Professor Emeritus at the Department of Psychology of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He is considered a pioneer of cross-cultural psychology and his research focuses on the cognitive aspects of attitudes, norms, roles and values in different cultures. &&&&& &&&&& Education and career &&&&& Triandis was born in Greece in 1926. During the Second World War, he learned four foreign languages and developed his curiosity about the differences that exist between cultures. His time getting to know people across various European nations inspired him to research cultural disparities in the way people think. At age twenty, he moved to Canada where he graduated as an engineer at McGill University in 1951. Three years later, he obtained a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Toronto. During this time, he was exposed to the work of psychology and pursued further education in this field. In 1958, he completed his doctoral education in Social Psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He is currently Professor Emeritus at the Psychology Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. &&&&& Triandis's early contributions to the field of cross-cultural psychology involved the development of several culture-sensitive measurements. He has been president of several academic societies such as the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (1976), the Interamerican Society of Psychology (1987-1989), the Association of Applied Psychology (1990-1994), and Division 8 and 9 of the American Psychological Association in 1977 and 1976, respectively. Triandis is well-known for his extensive research on individualism and collectivism. &&&&& &&&&& Awards and honors &&&&& * Career Contribution Award, Society of Personality and Social Psychology (2011) &&&&& * Lifetime Contributions Award, International Academy for Intercultural Research (2004) &&&&& * Award for Outstanding International Psychologist, American Psychological Association (2002) &&&&& * James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award, American Psychological Society (1996) &&&&& * Award for Distinguished Contributions to International Psychology, American Psychological Association (1994) &&&&& * Award for Distinguished Lecturer of the Year, American Psychological Association (1994) &&&&& * Otto Klineberg Award, Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (1994) &&&&& * Centennial Citation, American Psychological Association (1992) &&&&& * Distinguished Fulbright Professor to India (1983) &&&&& * Honorary Fellow, International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (1982) &&&&& * Interamerican Psychology Award, Interamerican Society of Psychology (1981) &&&&& &&&&& Select publications &&&&& * Triandis, Harry S. 1995.

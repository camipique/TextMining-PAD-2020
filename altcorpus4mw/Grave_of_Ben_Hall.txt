Grave of Ben Hall &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Grave of Ben Hall''' is a heritage-listed headstone of bushranger Ben Hall at Forbes Cemetery, Bogan Gate Road, Forbes, Forbes Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of a group of historic sites labelled the '''Ben Hall Sites''' for their association with bushranger Ben Hall, along with Ben Hall's Death Site, the Bushranger Hotel, Cliefden, Escort Rock and Wandi. It is also known as '''Ben Hall's Grave'''. The property is owned by Forbes Shire Council.

He was buried in the Forbes Cemetery on Sunday 7 May 1865. His funeral hearse was followed by about 50 people and three buggies - some family and some curious locals. &&&&& &&&&& The grave was probably initially unmarked, being surrounded by a picket fence sometime before 1900. In 1957 the grave was marked with a stone that had in rough black paint Ben Hall's details. Around 1957 author Edgar Penzig and a local erected the present marker. Ben Hall's age as inscribed on the headstone has been disputed and some claim he was in fact 28 years old when he died.

Fantasy for violin and piano (Schubert) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& Franz Schubert composed his '''Fantasy''' (German: ; French: ) in C major for violin and piano, Op. posth. 159,  934, in December 1827. It was the last of his compositions for violin and piano, and was premiered in January 1828 by the violinist and the pianist Carl Maria von Bocklet at the Landhaussaal in Vienna. &&&&& &&&&& The difficult work was "calculated to display Slavík's virtuoso violin technique" and is demanding for both instruments. According to pianist Nikolai Lugansky, the Fantasy "is the most difficult music ever written for the piano", and "more difficult than all of Rachmaninov’s piano concertos put together". &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& === Citations === &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& === Sources === &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * YouTube WQXRClassical: Fantasie in C major, D 934 - Tessa Lark (violin) & Renana Gutman (piano) &&&&& * YouTube chambermusicsociety: Fantasie in C major, D 934 - Benjamin Beilman (violin) & Juho Pohjonen (piano) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

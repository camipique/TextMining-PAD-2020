Islets in Pink Polypropylene &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Islets in Pink Polypropylene''''' is the debut studio album by English visual artist and experimental composer Anthony Manning, released on December 1, 1994 on Irdial Discs. &&&&& &&&&& Background and composition &&&&& ''Islets in Pink Polypropylene'' was created entirely on a Roland R-8, despite its incapability of being a synthesizer, through an unorthodox and complex process that according to Manning took "many weeks per piece". While in ownership of the drum machine, he took advantage of its pitch-shifting values by mapping them out in multiples of 400, listening to sounds from a PCM sound card, and consequently making a microtonal scale. Manning later began to note the structure of his pieces down on graph paper, drawing each track out using the Y axis for pitch and the X axis for time. &&&&& &&&&& After the record was finished, Manning claims 'that he finally got a chance to sleep again'; the making of the record supposedly resulted in him experiencing severe sleep deprivation. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& Islets in Pink Polypropylene received positive reception upon release. For example, The Wire abstractly praised the album, calling it 'a liquidy headbox of aural shapes, whose forms hardly change yet seem to encompass infinite viscosity within them, like rainbow pools of oil on water.' Later, upon being reissued on May 12th, 2016, it also received more positive reception. Record distributor Boomkat commented that 'it ''is'' a friendly, memorably involving listen; you might just have to work around its more autistic elements to find a way in'. John Twells, writing for Fact Magazine, praised the album, stating that 'itâ€™s refreshing to hear an all-electronic album that sounds so organic yet so totally alien.' &&&&& &&&&& Track listing &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& * Production, arrangements - Anthony Manning &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

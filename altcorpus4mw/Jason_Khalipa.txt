Jason Khalipa &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jason Khalipa''' (born October 2, 1985 in San Jose, California) is an American professional CrossFit Games athlete and 2008 CrossFit Games champion. &&&&& &&&&& Khalipa also received the Spirit of the Games award at the 2009 CrossFit Games and is the founder of NCFIT (formerly NorCal CrossFit). He was selected to participate as a member of Team USA in 2012, 2013, and 2014 CrossFit Games Invitational. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Khalipa was born in San Jose, California, and he grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Arch Bishop Mitty in San Jose where he played for the varsity football team as a nose guard. He also participated in track and field for the shot-put event. After high school, Khalipa attended college at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California, but he did not participate in organized sports. Instead, Khalipa focused on education and began training in his spare time for the CrossFit Games. He graduated from Santa Clara University with a Bachelors of Arts in Business Management. Once Khalipa graduated from college, he began training full time to participate in his first CrossFit Games in 2008 where he finished in first place and claimed the title as the "Fittest Man on Earth". This achievement led Khalipa to create the notion of the AMRAP Mentality, which means As Many Reps As Possible, and he used this state of mind as the foundation behind pursuing a career in fitness. Khalipa then applied the AMRAP Mentality to his life outside the gym and became dedicated to learning more about health and fitness as a competitor and a coach. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& In January 2016, Khalipa’s daughter Ava was diagnosed with leukemia. After Ava’s final treatment in 2018, Khalipa and his wife Ashley have since focused on spreading awareness for pediatric cancer. &&&&& &&&&& CrossFit Games results &&&&& After placing first in his first CrossFit Games in 2008, Khalipa went on to participate in six more Crossfit Games as an Individual: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In 2015, he competed as a team member with his affiliate, NorCal CrossFit, in the team competition. He briefly participated in the 2017 Open, but withdrew after one event. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Games &&&&& &&&&& Regionals &&&&& &&&&& Open (Worldwide) &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2008 &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' &&&&& &&&&& — &&&&& &&&&& No Open or Regionals in this season &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2009 &&&&& &&&&& 5th &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& — &&&&& &&&&& No Open in this season, instead of Regionals there were SectionalsAs a previous Games champion, Khalipa pre-qualified for the 2009 Games and did not participate in SectionalsSpirit of the Games winner &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2010 &&&&& &&&&& 16th &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& — &&&&& &&&&& No Open in this seasonAs a previous Games champion, Khalipa pre-qualified for the 2010 Games and did not participate in Regionals &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2011 &&&&& &&&&& 7th &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' (Northern California) &&&&& &&&&& 11th &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2012 &&&&& &&&&& 5th &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' (Northern California) &&&&& &&&&& 10th &&&&& &&&&& Team USA at CrossFit Invitational &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2013 &&&&& &&&&& 2nd &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' (Northern California) &&&&& &&&&& 7th &&&&& &&&&& Team USA at CrossFit Invitational &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2014 &&&&& &&&&& 3rd &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' (Northern California) &&&&& &&&&& 2nd &&&&& &&&&& Team USA at CrossFit Invitational &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2015Team &&&&& &&&&& 10th &&&&& &&&&& '''1st''' (California) &&&&& &&&&& '''1st'''(4th Individual) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * ''AMRAP Mentality'' (2018) &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

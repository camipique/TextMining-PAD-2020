Jason-Antigone Dane &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jason-Antigone Dane (Dhousis)''' (Ιάσων-Αντιγόνη Δούσης) is a Greek activist, best known for nude activism on LGBTQI+ issues. Dane identifies as non-binary, and is known for winning a legal battle to erase gender from identification documents and for legally self-identifying as gender neutral. Dane has also been a prominent voice in Greece's debate over extending the right of foster care and adoption to gay couples. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& &&&&& Dane was born in Athens, Greece in the 13th of August 1985 and raised in the neighborhood of Kolonaki. Dane graduated from Athens College, then joined the 2nd experimental Lyceum of Athens, and went on to graduate from the Department of Theatre Studies at the University of Patras with honours. Dane continued studies in theatre, joining the drama school of Roula Pateraki, graduating with honours, and later moved to London, working in famous gay clubs and becoming more interested and active in human and animal rights and veganism. Later, Dane returned to Greece to study human rights at the University of Athens. &&&&& &&&&& Activism &&&&& === Nude activism === &&&&& After returning to Greece, Dane created tension in the gay community with naked protests that included slogans written on the naked body. Dane changed names by adding the name ''Antigone'' (from the mythic heroine) next to the baptismal first name ''Jason''. &&&&& &&&&& === ID trail === &&&&& In November 2017, Dane took legal steps to ask to legally be referred as gender neutral, with gender erased from Dane's ID. That came one month after a bill was passed from the Parliament to allow people to change the gender on their identity cards. However, Dane wanted gender to be erased entirely. Dane was the first person to ask for official recognition as a non-binary person. Dane identifies as neither a man nor a woman, neither male or female, but non-binary and specifically as genderqueer. During the hearing, Dane was accompanied by Grigoris Valianatos. &&&&& &&&&& In February 2018, the court ruled in favour of allowing Dane to identify as a non-binary person on identity cards, but not to totally erase gender from the cards. &&&&& &&&&& === Bill on LGBT adoption === &&&&& Dane was under the spotlight of mass media when attending the House of the Hellenic Parliament for LGBT adoption on May 9, 2018. During the hearing, MP Kostas Katsikis stated that homosexuality was a crime equal to Pedophilia. Dane left the house as a sign of disapproval. &&&&& &&&&& === Candidate councilor in Athens === &&&&& &&&&& Jason-Antigone is a candidate councillor in Athens, with Rena Dourou, affiliated with the governing Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza). His candidacy sparked many negative comments by internet trolls. He is an admirer of Alexis Tsipras. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Interview at the Night Show, ANT1 TV. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

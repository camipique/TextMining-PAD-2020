Journal of Mathematical Physics, Analysis, Geometry &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''''Journal of Mathematical Physics, Analysis, Geometry''''' is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering mathematics as applied to physics. It is published by the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering and was established in 1944 as '''''Mathematical Physics, Analysis, Geometry'''''. Papers are published in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. The journal is abstracted and indexed by Scopus. According to the ''Journal Citation Reports'', the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 0.531. &&&&& &&&&& Editors-in-chief &&&&& The following persons are or have been editors-in-chief: &&&&& * Vladimir Marchenko: 1994—1999 &&&&& * Iossif Ostrovskii: 2000—2004 &&&&& * Leonid Pastur: 2005—present &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The Kharkov Mathematical Society was founded in 1879 and , starting in 1880, the society published the journal named ''Communications of the Kharkov Mathematical Society'' (Russian ''Сообщения и протоколы заседаний математического общества при Императорском Харьковском университете''). Publication was suspended in 1960, but in 1965 due to the efforts of Naum Akhiezer the journals ''Theory of functions, functional analysis and their applications'', and ''Ukrainian Geometric Collection»'' were established. In 1994, these journals were merged by the Mathematical Division of the Verkin Institute to establish the current journal. The first editor was Vladimir Marchenko. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

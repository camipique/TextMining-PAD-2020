HMS Utile (1804) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''HMS ''Utile''''' was the mercantile ''Volunteer'', launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1803, that the Admiralty purchased for the Royal Navy. She had an undistinguished 10-year naval career before Admiralty sold her in 1814. She resumed the name ''Volunteer'' and after a voyage to Martinique she traded between London and Bordeaux. She was last listed in 1822. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& ===Mercantile ''Volunteer''=== &&&&& ''Volunteer'' appeared in the ''Register of Shipping'' in 1804 with Rudd, master, Bulmer & Co., owners, and trade Newcastle–London. &&&&& &&&&& ===Royal Navy=== &&&&& The Navy purchased ''Volunteer'' in June 1804. She underwent fitting at Deptford in May-June, and then between 12 June and 4 August at Deptford Dockyard.

''Utile'' also lent her eight crew men to work ''Euphrates'' into dock. &&&&& &&&&& ''Utile'' was part of a fleet under Admiral Douglas when in the morning of 24 April a squadron under sighted twenty-six French vessels rounding Cap Gris Nez. The British captured seven schuyts, which were all of 25 to 28 tons burthen, and carried in all 117 soldiers and 43 seamen under the command of officers from the 51st. Infantry Regiment. The French convoy had been bound for Ambleteuse from Dunkirk. On the British side the only casualty was one man wounded.

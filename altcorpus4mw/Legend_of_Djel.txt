Legend of Djel &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Legend of Djel''''' is a 1989 adventure game developed by Coktel Vision and Inférence, and published by Tomahawk for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& Tomahawk was launched as a sister company to Coktel Vision in early 1989. Its first release – ''Emmanuelle'' – was negatively reviewed by critics but it helped to spread buzz around the brand name. ''Legend of Djel'' was one of many featured in an ''Amiga Computing'' preview in August 1989. The sorcerer's daughter is visually based on the girlfriend of the game's graphic artist. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& The player takes the role of a gnome named Djel. On their deathbed, his parents ask him to clear their name, proving they were of good moral character and not the magic-using troublemakers they were known for. He also needs to defeat a sorcerer. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& The game is a point-and-click adventure featuring 30 drawn screens. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& ''Amiga Computing'' criticised both the gameplay and story for being unoriginal. ''Amiga Format'' felt the game had neither appeal nor depth. ''The Retro Spirit'' thought it was "a bizarre creation only the French knows how to do". ''The Games Machine'' felt the title was graphically and sonically impressive. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Amiga Joker review (German) &&&&& * ASM review &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

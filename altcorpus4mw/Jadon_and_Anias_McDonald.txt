Jadon and Anias McDonald &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Jadon and Anias McDonald''' are a pair of formerly conjoined craniopagus twins. They were separated in a nearly 30 hour surgery on October 14, 2016 at Children's Hospital at Montefiore when they were thirteen months old. &&&&& &&&&& Less than a year after they were separated, they returned home to their house in New York's Orange County to live with parents, Nicole and Chrisitian, and older brother, Aza. Before they were separated, the boys and family lived in the Bronx but they purchased the home in foreclosure while the boys were in rehab at Blythedale Children's Hospital. At home, they will have 20 hours a week of in-home therapy. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Heilbronn set &&&&& Introduction &&&&& In mathematics, a '''Heilbronn set''' is an infinite set ''S'' of natural numbers for which every real number can be arbitrarily closely approximated by a fraction whose denominator is inÂ ''S''. For any given real number and natural number , it is easy to find the integer such that is closest to . For example, for the real number and we have . If we call the closeness of to the difference between and , the closeness is always less than 1/2 (in our example it is 0.15926...). A collection of numbers is a Heilbronn set if for any we can always find a sequence of values for in the set where the closeness tends to zero. &&&&& &&&&& More mathematically let denote the distance from to the nearest integer then is a Heilbronn set if and only if for every real number and every there exists such that . &&&&& &&&&& Examples &&&&& The natural numbers are a Heilbronn set as Dirichlet's approximation theorem shows that there exists with . &&&&& &&&&& The th powers of integers are a Heilbronn set. This follows from a result of I. M. Vinogradov who showed that for every and there exists an exponent and such that . In the case Hans Heilbronn was able to show that may be taken arbtrarily close to 1/2. Alexandru Zaharescu has improved Heilbronn's result to show that may be taken arbitrarily close to 4/7. &&&&& &&&&& Any Van der Corput set is also a Heilbronn set. &&&&& &&&&& Example of a non-Heilbronn set &&&&& The powers of 10 are not a Heilbronn set. Take then the statement that for some is equivalent to saying that the decimal expansion of has run of three zeros or three nines somewhere. This is not true for all real numbers. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

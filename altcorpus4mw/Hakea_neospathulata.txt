Hakea neospathulata &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Hakea neospathulata''''' is a shrub of the genus ''Hakea'' in the family, Proteaceae, native to an area in the Mid West, and western Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. &&&&& &&&&& The open shrub typically grows to a height of . It blooms from August to September and produces red flowers. &&&&& &&&&& An earlier description in 2006 by Young confined ''Hakea spathulata'' (nom. illeg.) to a limited area: between Murchison River and Dandaragan, and protected. &&&&& &&&&& In 2014, renamed as ''H. neospathulata'' by I.M. Turner with a broader range, and not endangered taxon. &&&&& &&&&& Found in IBRA Regions: Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain. &&&&& &&&&& Taxonomy &&&&& This species was first described as ''Hakea auriculata'' var ''spathulata'' by George Bentham in 1870, and raised to species level in 1990 as ''H. spathulata'' by Barker. However, the name was illegitimate as ''H. spathulata'' had already been validly published by Johannes Theodor Schmalhausen in 1883 as the name of a fossil hakea species found in Russia. Thus, in 2014 Turner renamed the species ''H. neospathulata''. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

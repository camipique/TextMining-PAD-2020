High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine''' () is to be established by March 2019. Cases concerning corruption in Ukraine will be bought directly to this court. The jurisdiction of the court covers crimes that caused damage of an equivalent of at least 31 thousand USD. Appeals will be considered by a completely separate Appeal Chamber of the High Anti-Corruption Court. &&&&& &&&&& Structure &&&&& The court will have 35 judges appointed and at least 10 of them appointed to the Appeals Chamber. These judges and persons living with them, spouses, parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents, spouseâ€™s parents, grandchildren, adopted children and foster parents will be provided with a full protection. The judges will be elected by the ''High Judicial Qualifications Commission'' with the help of the ''Public Council of International Experts'' (a new body of six people that consists of foreign experts). &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& In December 2016 Minister of Justice Pavlo Petrenko said that a relevant bill for establishing a special anti-corruption court was ready to be sent to the Ukrainian parliament. Parliament saw the draft in December 2017. Parliament adopted the final version of this law on 7 June 2018. The law on the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine came into force on 14 June 2018. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed the law "On the Establishment of the High Anti-Corruption Court" on 26 June 2018. &&&&& &&&&& The law had undergone about 2,000 amendments during its passage. The International Monetary Fund will have to assess if it is sufficient to meet its anti-corruption requirements to release the next tranche of money under its $17.5 billion cash-for-reforms agreement. The court is set to be established during the first quarter of 2019. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Corruption in Ukraine &&&&& *National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

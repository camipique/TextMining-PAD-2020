Jeanette Threlfall &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jeanette Threlfall''' (pen name, '''J. T.'''; 24 March 1821 – 30 November 1880) was an English hymnwriter of the Victorian era and author of other sacred poems. She published ''Woodsorrel'', 1856; ''The Babe and the Princess'', 1864; ''Sunshine and Shadow'', 1873; and two little prose works. &&&&& &&&&& Threlfall was brought up by an uncle and other relatives as her parents died when she was young. Suffering from poor health during the greater part of her life served to deepen her spiritual faith, and gave her time to write hymns. Her literary and religious accomplishment were lauded after her death in 1880, by such authorities as Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean Frederic Farrar, and Bishop (Christopher Wordsworth. "We praise Thee in the morning" may be taken as a specimen of her style, while her Palm Sunday hymn, "Hosanna! loud hosanna", was very popular with children. &&&&& &&&&& Early years and education &&&&& Jeannette Threlfall was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, on 24 March 1821. She was the daughter of Henry Threlfall, wine merchant, and Catherine Eccles, the latter a somewhat noticeable local family, who disapproved of the marriage. &&&&& &&&&& Orphaned early in life, she became the “beloved inmate” (as a memorial-card bears) of the households successively of her uncle and aunt Bamnister and Mary Jane Eccles, at Park Place, Blackburn, and Golden Hill, Leyland, Lancashire; and later of their daughter, Sarah Alice Aston, and her husband, of Dean's Yard, Westminster. &&&&& &&&&& From about twelve years of age, her education was left to itself, but her great love of reading, combined with delicate health, prevented this from being a great disadvantage. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Threlfall worked as a Sunday school teacher. Throughout her life, she was a great reader, and made time to write sacred poems and hymns. These were sent anonymously to various periodicals. They were first collected and issued in a small volume, entitled ''Woodsorrel; or, Leaves from a Retired Home, by J. T.'', (London: J. Nisbet, 1856). The thirty-five poems in the volume did not appear to gain any notice except among friends. In 1873, she selected fifteen pieces from ''Woodsorrel'' and added 55 others, and published them as ''Sunshine and Shadow. Poems by Jeannette Threlfall. With Introduction by the Lord Bishop of Lincoln (Wordsworth)'' (London: Hunt). A third edition (1880) was entitled ''New Edition. With In Memoriam from the Sermons of the Dean of Westminster and Canon Farrar''. The two memorial tributes were characterized as very tender and sweet. &&&&& &&&&& Of Threlfall's hymns, those in collection include:— 1. ''Hosanna! loud hosanna, The little children sang''. (Palm Sunday) 2. ''I think of Thee, O Saviour''. (Good Friday). 3. ''Lo, to us a child is born''. (Christmas). 4. ''Thou bidd'st us seek Thee early''. (Early Piety.) 5. ''We praise Thee in the morning''. (Morning.) 6. ''When from Egypt's house of bondage''. (Children as Pilgrims.) These hymns are all taken from Threlfall's ''Sunshine and Shadow'', 1873. ''I think of Thee, O Saviour''was written during an illness, at her dictation, by a friend. ''Hosanna! loud hosanna, The little children sang'' was the most widely used of her compositions. &&&&& &&&&& In 1877, Threlfall slipped during a carriage accident. The injuries led to a leg amputation. A second accident rendered her a helpless invalid. She bore her sufferings well, retaining a positive attitude till her death, 30 November 1880. Threlfall was interred at Highgate Cemetery, 4 December 1880. &&&&& &&&&& Themes and reception &&&&& In Julian (1892) it is remarked that her sacred poems were not well written, nor noticeable in thought or sentiment, but nonetheless, all through, a sweet spirit utters itself. &&&&& &&&&& Remarks by Stanley included:— &&&&& &&&&& Remarks by Farrar included:— &&&&& &&&&& Wordsworth praised her poems, and observed:— &&&&& &&&&& Of Threlfall's "Hosanna! loud hosanna" (Matth. xxi. 15.), listed as a Whitsuntide hymn in ''Home Words'' (1868), Frances Ridley Havergal commented in 1881, that it "has become in the fullest sense a standard hymn. It is one of the brightest and most graceful hymns for the little ones that can adorn any collection". &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ===Attribution=== &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& ===Bibliography=== &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

824	Droggn
Droggn &&&&& Introduction &&&&&  &&&&& '''Droggn''' is an extinct card game from the Austrian branch of the Tarock family for three players that was played in the Stubai valley in Tyrol, Austria until the 1980s. ''Droggn'' is originally local dialect for "to play Tarock" (in standard German usually "tarockieren"), but it has become the proper name of this specific Tarock variant. An unusual feature of the game compared with other Tarock games is the use of a 66-card deck and the fact there is no record in the literature of a 66-card game and no current manufacturers of a such a deck. &&&&& &&&&& Aim &&&&& To win the 37 (or 38) of the 74 card points available. &&&&& &&&&& Players &&&&& The game is played with three players. Four can play if the dealer "takes a holiday" (''er feiert'') i.e. when it is their turn players deal but do not participate in that hand. &&&&& &&&&& Cards &&&&& The game is played with a 66-card French-suited Tarock card deck. In practice, players used a 78-card variant of the Industrie und Glück pattern deck and stripped out the lowest 3 cards of each suit. An alternative is the Tarot Nouveau pattern deck or, appropriately, the Tiroler Tarock 78-card pack depicting historical Tyrolean battle scenes and produced by Piatnik. &&&&& &&&&& === Card pack === &&&&& The pack thus comprises: &&&&& &&&&& * 21 trumps numbered XXI to I. &&&&& * 11 cards per suit as follows: &&&&& ** K D R B 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 &&&&& ** K D R B 2 3 4 5 6 7 &&&&& * The ''Gstieß'' (the Fool, ''L'Excuse'' or ''Sküs'') &&&&& &&&&& The court cards are the King (''König''), Queen (''Dame''), Rider (''Reiter'') and Jack or Valet (''Bube'') hence the lettering. &&&&& &&&&& === Card values === &&&&& The values of the individual cards in card points (''Augen'') are as follows: &&&&& * Trull cards (''Gstieß'', XXI and I) - 5 points &&&&& * Honours or Kings - 5 points &&&&& * Queens - 4 points &&&&& * Riders - 3 points &&&&& * Valets - 2 points &&&&& * Other tarocks and pip cards - 1 points &&&&& &&&&& === Card names === &&&&& Card names, which sometimes vary from other Austrian Tarock games, are as follows: &&&&& &&&&& * Tarocks - ''Trümpfe'' ("trumps") or ''Addude'' (from the French ''atout'') &&&&& * Trump XXI - ''Mond'' or ''der Große'' ("the big one") &&&&& * Trump I - ''Pagat'' or ''der Kleine / dar Kloane'' ("the littl' un") &&&&& * Sküs - ''Gstieß'' &&&&& * King - ''König'' or ''Honor'' ("honour") &&&&& * Queen - ''Dame'' / ''de Dam'' &&&&& * Rider - ''Reiter'' &&&&& * Valet - ''Bube'' / ''dar Bua'' &&&&& * Pip cards - ''leere / laare Karten'' &&&&& * Court cards - ''Mandlen'' &&&&& * Long suit - ''der Ritt'' &&&&& * Singleton - ''der Fuchs'' (normally a suit card in declarer's hand other than the King) &&&&& &&&&& Dealing &&&&& The dealer is chosen by cutting the pack; the highest card wins. Dealing and play are clockwise, unlike other Tarock games. After shuffling the cards, the dealer offers the pack to the player on his right, who cuts. The dealer then deals 3 packets of 7 cards to each player and places the last 3 cards face down on the table to form the talon. &&&&& &&&&& Bidding &&&&& Bidding is clockwise and each player gets one bid. The bids, in order starting with the lowest, are: &&&&& &&&&& * ''Ansager'' - normal game announced by saying "bid" (''"ich sage an / i sag on"''). Declarer exchanges with the talon and 'buys' a nominated card from the player who holds it (see below). &&&&& * ''Solo'' - declarer exchanges with the talon only. &&&&& * ''Super'' - declarer does not use the talon or buy a card. &&&&& * ''Super Mord'' - declarer offers to take every trick and the talon is his also. &&&&& &&&&& Players may "pass" (''weiter''). If everyone passes the cards are thrown in and re-dealt. &&&&& &&&&& Exchanging with the talon &&&&& For normal games and Solos, the declarer is allowed to exchange 3 cards with the talon, but may not discard the trull cards. The discards count as one of the declarer's tricks. A King must be discarded with a trump. &&&&& &&&&& In normal contracts, the declarer is allowed to 'buy' a card by placing a card on the table and ask for a card of his choice. The player with that card must hand it over and take the discard. &&&&& &&&&& Bonuses and announcements &&&&& === Bonuses === &&&&& The following bonuses are permitted: &&&&& &&&&& * Pagat ultimo - a player wins the last trick with the Pagat. Doubled if announced beforehand by placing the Pagat face-up by the talon at the start. &&&&& * Gstieß ultimo - ditto for the Gstieß but this is only permitted in a Super Mord. &&&&& &&&&& === Announcements === &&&&& After the declarer has exchanged, discarded, bought a card and laid off a Pagat or Gstieß, the defenders in clockwise order, may now "stick" or "double". If they want to stick they say "good" (''gut'') or "pass" (''komm'') and the opportunity passes to the left. If they want to double the game or bonus value they may declare ''schiessen'' or a ''schwacher''. This doubles the value for both defenders. The declarer may respond "good" or double the stakes again with a "retour" (''Retour''). The higher stakes apply to both game and bonus even they may go to different players. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * at www.pagat.com. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

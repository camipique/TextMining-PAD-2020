Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus! &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus!''''' is an upcoming television film written by Jhonen Vasquez, Breehn Burns and Gary Wilson, and directed by Vasquez and Jake Wyatt. It is based on the animated television series ''Invader Zim'', which was created by Vasquez and originally aired on Nickelodeon and later Nicktoons from 2001 to 2006. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& Zim discovers The Almighty Tallest never had any intentions of coming to Earth and as a result he loses confidence in himself for the first time in his life, which is the big break his human nemesis Dib has been waiting for. &&&&& &&&&& Voice cast &&&&& &&&&& *Richard Steven Horvitz as Zim &&&&& *Rosearik Rikki Simons as GIR &&&&& *Andy Berman as Dib Membrane &&&&& *Melissa Fahn as Gaz Membrane &&&&& *Rodger Bumpass as Professor Membrane &&&&& *Wally Wingert as Almighty Tallest Red &&&&& *Kevin McDonald as Almighty Tallest Purple &&&&& *Jhonen Vasquez as Zim's Computer &&&&& *Olivia d'Abo as Tak &&&&& *Paul Greenberg as Poonchy &&&&& &&&&& Announcement &&&&& On November 8, 2016, ''Harvey Beaks'' and ''Chowder'' creator C. H. Greenblatt was asked by a fan on Tumblr if he would work with Jhonen Vasquez on an hypothetical ''Invader Zim'' movie, and Greenblatt responded, "Jhonen IS making an ''Invader Zim'' movie for Nick. I'm not a part of it, but I'm excited." However, Jhonen initially denied this on his Twitter, most likely because he was under contract to not say anything at the time and was forced to dismiss it as a "rumor". &&&&& &&&&& On April 4, 2017, over sixteen years since the series' debut and eleven years since the last "unaired" episode premiered in the United States, Nickelodeon announced that they had green-lit a 90-minute television film based on the series. &&&&& &&&&& At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, Jhonen explains that Nickelodeon had been asking him about doing more ''Invader Zim'' for years and that he always had to decline their offers either because he was busy working on something else or due to not being able to come to an agreement with Nickelodeon on a budget for a Invader Zim revival; but being "completely miserable" with the other things he was working on at the time, Jhonen accepted Nickelodeon's latest offer to do more ''Invader Zim''. Nickelodeon initially wanted a new ''Invader Zim'' television series, but Jhonen suggested a six-episode miniseries instead. He soon changed his mind to a television movie, since doing a movie would be "infinitely less stressful". &&&&& &&&&& ===Promotion=== &&&&& Three teaser trailers for the movie were released in the next four days following the initial announcement. &&&&& &&&&& ''Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus!'' had a panel at San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2018; during the panel, some never-before-seen production art such as backgrounds and turn-around charts for the movie were revealed. A trailer put together out of unedited first take animation for the movie was also shown at the panel accompanied by some original music composed for the trailer by Kevin Manthei. During the panel, Jhonen explained that he put the trailer together out of some random animated footage he had for the movie that he thought looked presentable enough to show people and that most of the shots used in the trailer were going to be sent back overseas to be re-animated. &&&&& &&&&& Production &&&&& ''Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus!'' is produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio in collaboration with Maven Animation Studio in South Korea. During the ''Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus!'' panel at San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2018, Jhonen revealed that they had written the movie in 2015 and that at the time of the panel, they were currently in the process of getting first take animation back from their overseas animation team, Maven Animation Studio. &&&&& &&&&& Jhonen Vasquez will be returning as executive producer and as the voice of Zimâ€™s computer, along with Kevin Manthei as the composer, and Jenny Goldberg, who worked on the ''Invader Zim'' comic book series, will be the art director for the movie. Most of the cast members from the television series will be reprising their roles in the movie, including Richard Steven Horvitz as Zim, Rosearik Rikki Simons as GIR, Andy Berman as Dib, Melissa Fahn as Gaz, Wally Wingert as Almighty Tallest Red, Kevin McDonald as Almighty Tallest Purple, Rodger Bumpass as Professor Membrane, Olivia d'Abo as Tak and Paul Greenberg as Poonchy. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

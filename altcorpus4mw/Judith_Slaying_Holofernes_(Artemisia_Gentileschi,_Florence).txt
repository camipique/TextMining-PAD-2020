Judith Slaying Holofernes (Artemisia Gentileschi, Florence) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''''Judith Slaying Holofernes''''' is a 1620â€“1621 painting by Artemisia Gentileschi, now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Like her earlier version of the work, Judith is thought to be a self-portrait. Holofernes is thought to be Agostino Tassi, the mentor her father hired to teach Artemesia because women were not allowed to attend the art academy. She was raped by Tassi while under his tutelage. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

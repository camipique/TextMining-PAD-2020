Daniel Tordera &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Daniel Tordera Salvador''' (born 17 January 1986) is a Researcher at Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Tordera was born in Valencia, where he studied chemistry at the University of Valencia and graduated in 2009. He then moved to Strasbourg, where he earned his Material Science Engineers degree at the École européene de chimie, polymères et matériaux. He earned his PhD at the University of Valencia in 2014, working on light-emitting electrochemical cells. He worked as a researcher at the University of Linköping, studying photonics and plasmonic materials. He is now a researcher at Holst Centre (TNO) in Eindhoven. &&&&& &&&&& Research &&&&& Tordera joined University of Valencia in 2009 where he worked in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). He determined the elusive operational mechanism of LECs and dramatically increased the performance of these devices. He was a visiting scientist at University of California, Santa Barbara, where he applied his knowledge on conjugated polyelectrolytes. He then started a company with the aim of commercializing products based on his findings. He joined the University of Linköping to research the optical and thermal properties of plasmonic nanoholes. He worked on the development of a plasmonic thermoelectric device, a photoconductive paper and a plasmonic display, among others. He is currently a researcher at Holst Centre leading a team working on near-infrarred organic photodetectors. He has published over 40 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and is the inventor of 3 patents. &&&&& &&&&& Awards &&&&& 2015 - Nanomatmol Award: Best PH.D. in Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials in Spain by the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry. &&&&& &&&&& 2015 - Outstanding Doctorate Award by the Universidad de Valencia. &&&&& &&&&& 2012 - European Materials Research Society Spring Meeting Young Scientist Award. &&&&& &&&&& 2010 - Award “Suschem Young Chemistry Researchers” to the Highest Academic Achievement in Spain by the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Daniel Tordera considers himself a politically active person. He has developed a satirical political video game Pedro Sanchez Simulator that was played by more than 50,000 people in less than a month and gained lot of media attention. He enjoys writing, photography and making music. &&&&& &&&&& He received the honor of being one of the 10 finalists to the 2018 Planeta awards for his novel "El Arte de la Fuga" &&&&& &&&&& External Links &&&&& * Google Scholar. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

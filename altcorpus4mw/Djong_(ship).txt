2960	Djong_(ship)
Djong (ship) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& A prauw jong, alt= &&&&& The '''djong''', '''jong''', or '''jung''' (also called '''junk''' in English) is a type of ancient sailing ship originating from Java that was widely used by Javanese and Malay sailors. The word was and is spelled ''jong'' in its languages of origin, the "djong" spelling being the colonial Dutch romanisation. &&&&& &&&&& Djongs are used mainly as seagoing passenger and cargo vessels. They traveled as far as Ghana or even Brazil in ancient times. The average burthen was 4-500 tons, with a range of 85-700 tons. In the Majapahit era these vessels were used as warships, but still predominantly as transport vessels. &&&&& &&&&& Etymology &&&&& The word ''jong'' or ''jung'' derives from the Chinese word for boat (船), originally pronounced ''ɦljon'' in Old Chinese. It is related to several Southeast Asian terms for boat, and entered the Indonesian and Malay languages at an early date. The word jong can be found in a number of ancient Javanese inscriptions dating to the 9th century. It is first recorded in the Malay language by the 15th century, when a Chinese word list identified it as a Malay term for ship. The late 15th century Malay Maritime Laws uses jong frequently as the word for freight ships. European writings from 1345 through 1601 use a variety of related terms, including jonque (French), ''ioncque'' (Italian), ''iuncque'' (Spanish), and ''ionco'' (Dutch). The "djong" spelling is of colonial Dutch origin, rendering the j sound as "dj", though both traditional British and current Indonesian orthography romanises it as ''jong''. &&&&& &&&&& In the Nusantara &&&&& The Nusantara archipelago was known for production of large junks. A Portuguese account described how the Javanese people already had advanced seafaring skills when they arrived: &&&&& When the Portuguese captured Malacca, they recovered a chart from a Javanese pilot, Albuquerque said: &&&&& For seafaring, the Malay people independently invented junk sails, made from woven mats reinforced with bamboo, at least several hundred years before 1 BC. By the time of the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) the Chinese were using such sails, having learned it from Malay sailors visiting their Southern coast. Beside this type of sail, they also made balance lugsails (tanja sails). The invention of these types of sail made sailing around the western coast of Africa possible, because of their ability to sail against the wind. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Duarte Barbosa reported that the ships from Java, which have four masts, are very different from Portuguese ships. A Javanese ship is made of very thick wood, and as it gets old, the Javanese fix it with new boards. The rope and the sail is made with osier. The Javanese junks were made using jaty/jati wood (teak) at the time of his report (1512), at that time Chinese junks were still using softwood as their main material. The Javanese ship's hull is formed by joining planks to the keel and then to each other by wooden dowels, without using either a frame (except for subsequent reinforcement), nor any iron bolts or nails. The vessel was similarly pointed at both ends, and carried two oar-like rudders and lateen-rigged sails. It differed markedly from the Chinese vessel, which had its hull fastened by strakes and iron nails to a frame and to structurally essential bulkheads which divided the cargo space. The Chinese vessel had a single rudder on a transom stern, and (except in Fujian and Guangdong) they had flat bottoms without keels. Historical engravings also depict usage of bowsprits and bowsprit sails, with deckhouse above the upper deck, and the appearance of stemposts and sternposts.Muria strait during Pati Unus reign. In 1657 this strait has been narrowed or disappeared. &&&&& Barbosa also reported various goods carried by these ships, which include rice, meat of cows, sheep, pigs, and deer, dried and salted, many chickens, garlic, and onions. Traded weapons include lances, dagger, and swords, worked in inlaid metal and very good steel. Also brought with them cubebs and yellow die called cazumba (''kasumba'') and gold which is produced in Java. Barosa mention places and route in which these ships visited, which include Malacca, China, Molucca Islands, Sumatra, Tenasserim, Pegu, Bengal, Palicat, Coromandel, Malabar, Cambay, and Aden. The passenger brought their wives and children, even some of them never leave the ship to go on shore, nor have any other dwelling, for they are born and die in the ship. &&&&& &&&&& The size and special requirements of the ''djong'' demanded access to expertise and materials not available everywhere. Consequently, the ''djong'' was mainly constructed in two major shipbuilding centres around Java: north coastal Java, especially around Rembang-Demak (along the Muria strait) and Cirebon; and the south coast of Borneo (Banjarmasin) and the adjacent islands. A common feature of these places was their accessibility to forests of teak, as this wood was highly valued because of its resistance to shipworm. Southern Borneo's supply of teak would have come from north Java, whereas Borneo itself would supply ironwood. Pegu, which is a large shipbuilding port at the 16th century, also produced jong, built by Javanese who resided there. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Greek Astronomer, Claudius Ptolemaeus, ca. AD 100, said in his work ''Geography'' that huge ships came from the east of India. This was also confirmed by an anonymous work called ''Periplus Marae Erythraensis''. Both mention a type of ship called ''kolandiaphonta'', which may be a translation of the Chinese word ''K'un-lun po''. &&&&& &&&&& The 3rd century book ''Strange Things of the South'' (南州異物志) by Wan Chen (萬震) describes ships capable of carrying 700 people together with more than 10,000 "斛" of cargo (250-1000 tons according to various interpretations). These ships came from ''K'un-lun'', meaning "Southern country" or "Islands below the wind." The ships called ''K'un-lun po'' (or ''K'un-lun bo''), could be more than 50 meters in length and had a freeboard of 4-7 meters. Wan Chen explains the ships' design as follows: A 260 CE book by Kang Tai (康泰) also described these ships as seven-masted vessels called ''K'un-lun po'' (Southern country ships) that could travel as far as Syria. The word "po" is derived from the Malay word proa-prauw-perahu, which means large ship. Note that in modern usage, perahu refers to a small boat. Faxian in his return journey to China from India (413-414) embarked a ship carrying 200 passengers and sailors from ''K'un-lun'' which towed a smaller ship. A cyclone struck and forced the passengers to move into the smaller ship. The crew of the smaller ship feared that the ship would be overloaded, therefore they cut the rope and separated from the big ship. Luckily the bigger ship survived, the passengers were stranded in ''Ye-po-ti'' (Yawadwipa - Java). After 5 months, the crew and the passengers built a new ship comparable in size to sail back to China.alt=In ''I-ch’ieh-ching yin-i'', a dictionary compiled by Huei-lin ca. 817 AD, po is mentioned several times:Ssu-ma Piao, in his commentary on Chuang Tzü, said that large ocean-going ships are called "po”. According to the Kuang Ya, po is an ocean-going ship. It has a draught of 60 feet (18 m). It is fast and carries 1000 men as well as merchandise. It is also called k’un-lun-po. &&&&& &&&&& In 1178, the Guangzhou customs officer Zhou Qufei, wrote in ''Lingwai Daida'' about the ships of the Southern country:The ships which sail the southern sea and south of it are like giant houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no going back to the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the cerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say "To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction". But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief. In 1322 friar Odoric of Pordenone reported that the archipelagic vessel of the ''zunc''um type carried at least 700 people, either sailors or merchants. &&&&& A hybrid Chinese/Javanese junk, the flag indicates that it is from one of the Sultanates in Indonesia &&&&& The Majapahit Empire used jongs as its main source of naval power. It is unknown how many exactly the total number of jong used by Majapahit, but they are grouped into 5 fleets. The largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs accompanied with uncountable malangbang and kelulus, when Majapahit attacked Pasai. Each ship was about long, with burthen around 500 tons and could carry 600 men. The ships were armed with 3 meter long cannons, and numerous smaller cetbangs. Prior to the Battle of Bubat in 1357, the Sunda king and the royal family arrived in Majapahit after sailing across the Java Sea by nine-decked hybrid Sino-Southeast Asian junks (Old Javanese: ''Jong sasanga wagunan'' ''ring Tatarnagari tiniru''). These hybrid junk incorporated Chinese techniques, such as using iron nails alongside wooden dowels and the construction of transom stern. &&&&& &&&&& Wang Dayuan's 1349 composition ''Daoyi Zhilüe Guangzheng Xia'' ("Description of the Barbarian of the Isles") described the so called "horse boats" at a place called Gan-mai-li in Southeast Asia. These ships were bigger than normal trading ships, with the sides constructed from multiple planks. The ships uses neither nails or mortar to join them, instead they are using coconut fibre. The ships has two or three decks, with deckhouse over the upper deck. In the lower hold they carried pressed-down frankincense, above them they are carrying several hundred horses. Wang made special mention of these ships because pepper, which is also transported by them, carried to places much away with large quantity. The normal trading ships carried less than 1/10 of their cargo. &&&&& &&&&& Usually, the main vessel towed behind a smaller "tender" for landing. Data from Marco Polo records made it possible to calculate that the largest ships may have had capacities of 500-800 tons, about the same as Chinese vessels used to trade in the 19th century. The tender itself may have been able to carry about 70 tons. &&&&& &&&&& Niccolò da Conti, in relating his travels in Asia between 1419 and 1444, describes ships much larger than European ships, capable of reaching 2,000 tons in size, with five sails and as many masts. The lower part is constructed with three planks, to withstand the force of the tempests to which they are much exposed. The ships are built in compartments, so that if one part is punctured, the other portion remaining intact to accomplish the voyage. &&&&& &&&&& Fra Mauro in his map explained that one junk rounded the Cape of Good Hope and traveled far into the Atlantic Ocean, in 1420: &&&&& Depiction of five, six, and seven masted jongs from left &&&&& The Portuguese historian João de Barros (1496–1570) wrote that when a violent storm arose as Albuquerque's fleet entered the vast waters between Sri Lanka and Aceh, a ship commanded by Simão Martinho was sunk, but his entire crew was rescued by Fernão Pires de Andrade and taken aboard his ship. To make up for this loss, the Portuguese captured and commandeered five ships from Gujarat that were sailing between Malacca and Sumatra. The small fleet of Albuquerque engaged an enemy "junk" ship of the Malaccan "Moors" near an island between Lumut and Belawan. According to Barros, they fought against this ship for two days. The enemy crew employed tactics of setting their own ship on fire as a means of burning Albuquerque's ships as they employed ramming techniques and close-range volleys of artillery. Although the ship surrendered, the Portuguese gained such an admiration for the junk and its crew that they nicknamed it ''O Bravo'' (The Brave Junk). The Portuguese crew pleaded with Fernão Pires to convince Albuquerque that the crew should be spared and viewed vassals of Portugal who were simply unaware of who they were actually fighting. Albuquerque eventually agreed to this. &&&&& &&&&& Passing by Pacem (Samudera Pasai) the Portuguese came across a ''Djong''—a junk larger and faster than their flagship, the Flor do Mar. At the time, the Portuguese currently had one squadron of 40-43 vessels. The Portuguese ordered it to halt but it promptly opened fire on the fleet, after which the Portuguese quickly followed suit. Reported by Gaspar Correia: &&&&& &&&&& Once aboard, the Portuguese found a member of the royal family of Pacem, whom Albuquerque hoped he could exchange for the Portuguese prisoners. &&&&& Illustration of Pati Unus' junk compared to an English galleon &&&&& In January 1513 Paty Onuz (also known as Fatih Yunus or Pati Unus) tried to surprise Malacca with 100 vessels with 5,000 Javanese from Jepara and Palembang. About 30 of those were junks weighing about 350-600 tons (except for Pati Unus' flagship), the rest being smaller boats of pangajava, lancaran, and kelulus types. These vessels carried much Javanese artillery. Although defeated, Pati Unus sailed home and beached his warship as a monument of a fight against men he called the bravest in the world, his exploit winning him a few years later the throne of Demak. In a letter to Afonso de Albuquerque, from Cannanore, 22 Feb. 1513, Fernão Pires de Andrade, the Captain of the fleet that routed Pate Unus, says: &&&&& &&&&& The Portuguese remarked that such large, unwieldy ships were weaknesses. The Portuguese succeeded in repelling the attack using smaller but more maneuverable ships. They did not specify the exact size of Pati Unus' junk, only noted that it must have been 4-5 times the size of Flor do Mar (a nau). This would make its size about 144-180 m, with the tonnage between 1600-2000 tons. Other scholars put it as low as 1000 tons, which indicates a length of 70-90 m. Impressed by this kind of ship, Albuquerque hired 60 Javanese carpenters and shipbuilders to work in Malacca. At least 1 jong was sailed to Portugal, to be deployed as coast guard ship at Sacavem under the instruction of king John III. &&&&& &&&&& Giovanni da Empoli (a Florentine merchant) said that in the land of Java, a junk is no different in its strength than a castle, because it had three and four boards, one above the other, which cannot be harmed with artillery. They sail with their women, children, and family, and everyone has a room to themselves. &&&&& &&&&& Tome Pires in 1515 wrote that the authorities of Canton (Guangzhou) made a law that obliged foreign ships to anchor at an island off-shore. He said that the Chinese made this law about banning ships from Canton for fear of the Javanese and Malays, for it was believed that one of their junks would rout 20 Chinese junks. China had more than a thousand junks, but one ship of 400 tons could depopulate Canton, and this depopulation would bring great loss to China. The Chinese feared that the city would be taken from them, because Canton was one of China's wealthiest city. &&&&& In 1574, queen Kalinyamat of Jepara attacked the Portuguese Malacca with 300 vessels, which included 80 jong of 400 tons burthen and 220 kelulus. The attacking force retreated after their supplies dwindled and 30 jongs has been set on fire by the Portuguese. It is also to be noted that by this time European ships has increased in size to 400-500 tons galleon.Banten jong with 2 mast and bowsprit sail, from 1646 Dutch engraving &&&&& Decline &&&&& A small Javanese jong, with western influenced sails and rigging, 1856. &&&&& Production of ''djongs'' ended in the 1700s, perhaps because of the decision of Amangkurat I of Mataram Sultanate to destroy ships on coastal cities and close ports to prevent them from rebelling. The disappearance of Muria strait denied the shipbuilders around Rembang-Demak access to open water. By 1677, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) reported that the Javanese no longer owned large ships and shipyards. When the VOC gained a foothold in Java, they prohibited the locals from building vessels more than 50 tons in tonnage and assigned European supervisors to shipyards. &&&&& &&&&& Replica &&&&& &&&&& * A small sized replica is moored along the Marine March of Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore. &&&&& &&&&& In popular culture &&&&& &&&&& * Jong is an Indonesian unique unit in Sid Meier's Civilization VI video game.

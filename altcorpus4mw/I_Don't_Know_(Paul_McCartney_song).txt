I Don't Know (Paul McCartney song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''I Don't Know'''" is a song by English musician Paul McCartney, released by Capitol Records as a double A-side single alongside "Come On to Me", ahead of McCartney's 17th studio album, ''Egypt Station''. &&&&& &&&&& McCartney's website described "I Don't Know" as a "plaintive, soul-soothing ballad as only Paul can deliver." &&&&& &&&&& In the 'Casual Conversation with Jarvis Cocker at LIPA' (25th July 2018), McCartney said that in his opinion John Lennon would like this song. &&&&& &&&&& Background, composition, and recording &&&&& In the 'Words Between Tracks' about writing a song, McCartney said: &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "I wrote this after going through a difficult period. Like people have nothing sort of madly serious or anything, but just one of those days when it’s like, "Oh my god, am I doing wrong here", you know. And sometimes that’s a good way to write a song, because you’re coming from your soul. And we often used to say that writing a song was like talking to a psychiatrist, a therapist or something. Because you’re saying it… You are saying it in a song rather than in a room to a specialist. Yeah, so it was me just thinking this problem out, and putting it into a song." &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The track was recorded at Henson Studios in Los Angeles, with additional sessions recorded at Hog Hill Mill (Sussex) and Abbey Road Studios. "I Don't Know" was also engineered by Steve Orchard, Alex Pasco, Billy Bush, Julian Burg and Greg Kurstin. &&&&& &&&&& Release &&&&& The song was officially issued on 20 June 2018. A month later, a limited edition numbered test pressing 7" vinyl featuring ''I Don't Know'' was released. There is only 200 copies of this kind of record.

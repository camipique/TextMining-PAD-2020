Jane Norman (actress) &&&&& Introduction &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& '''Jane Lazarus Norman''' (1933 - May 13, 2017) was an actress best known for her role as Pixanne in the children's television program of that same name that was broadcast in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& Born in Philadelphia, Norman was an only child, the daughter of Stanley and Jeanette Lazarus. Her father worked in the children's-dress-manufacturing business, and her mother was a musician who was trained in Europe. Norman was considered a child prodigy after she sat at a piano when she was 3 years old and played a Mozart sonata by ear. From that experience followed what Norman decades later described as "a lifelong love of music." When she was 8, she composed "Sad Story", a musical work that was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. When she was 16 years old, she headed to Maine by herself and lied about her age in order to work in summer stock theater. &&&&& &&&&& After graduating from Olney High School in Philadelphia, Norman earned a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education at Temple University with a minor in radio-TV-theater. While at Temple, she acted in the ''University of the Air'' and the ''Studio Schoolhouse'', both of which Temple produced and WFIL radio broadcast. &&&&& &&&&& She then became a kindergarten teacher and taught at Shoemaker School in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania. &&&&& &&&&& Television &&&&& Having her kindergarten students act out stories and put on plays, and writing songs for the students awakened an interest in a different direction for Norman's career, A meeting with executives at WCAU-TV in Philadelphia led to the creation of ''Pixanne,'' a show whose main character was essentially a female version of Peter Pan. Norman explained that the program centered around a pixie because from childhood she had wanted to fly. &&&&& &&&&& The children's program eventually branched out from Philadelphia TV into syndication, carried in 75 cities, and lasted 17 years. At one point, the show attracted 61 percent of the viewing audience in the Philadelphia market. Soon after it began, ''Pixanne's'' ratings exceeded those of ''Captain Kangaroo'', which preceded it daily. &&&&& &&&&& Norman became Pixanne for viewers to such an extent that a newspaper article contained the comment: "Pixanne is Jane Norman, and Jane Norman is Pixanne. And while it is possible to separate the two, the quality of each is the catalyst that has created this unique symbol of perpetual youthful innocence." &&&&& &&&&& Norman's experience with ''Pixanne'' led her to produce ''The National Kid's Quiz'' series, which was broadcast on NBC. She and her husband also made 117 episodes of ''Maintenance Ms.'', a series of 90-second TV spots designed to help women cope with various aspects of household maintenance. &&&&& &&&&& Writing &&&&& Norman wrote the books ''The Private Life of the American Teenager''. and ''Jane Normanâ€™s Fix It and Save'', a spinoff of the ''Maintenance Ms.'' TV spots. &&&&& &&&&& Singing &&&&& While making ''Pixanne'', Norman wrote, produced, and sang on two albums, ''The Musical Magic of Pixanne'' and ''Bloop or Blink''. &&&&& &&&&& In the 1990s, she launched a singing career, performing in nightclubs and recording. Her first CD, ''Pixanne Sings for Adults ... In a Christmas Mood'', included five of Norman's compositions in addition to seven Christmas standards. That Christmas album was followed by ''Madly in Love'', featuring "lush, sensuous standards" with accompaniment by a 47-piece orchestra. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Norman was married to television and video producer Jack Beazley. &&&&& &&&&& Death &&&&& On May 13, 2017, Norman died at her home in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. She was 83 years old. &&&&& &&&&& Recognition &&&&& On November 18, 2005, Norman was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&&  &&&&& * ''Jane Norman Chapter and Verse'' on YouTube &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

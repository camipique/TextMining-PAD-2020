''multiflorus'' is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth, flattened, egg-shaped leaf, long and wide. The leaf is held above ground on a stalk up to long and is often not fully developed at flowering time. When plants are not flowering, the leaf is much larger.

In 2006, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown reduced it to subspecies status. The subspecies epithet (''multiflorus'') is a Latin word meaning "many-flowered".} &&&&& &&&&& Distribution and habitat &&&&& The common bunny orchid is widespread and common in woodland and forest between Perth and Albany. &&&&& &&&&& Conservation &&&&& ''Eriochilus dilatatus'' subsp.

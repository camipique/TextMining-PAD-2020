Doom Eternal &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Doom Eternal''''' (stylized as '''''DOOM Eternal''''') is an upcoming first-person shooter developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Stadia, and Xbox One as the fifth main title in the ''Doom'' series and a sequel to 2016's ''Doom''. &&&&& &&&&& Gameplay &&&&& Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer, an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of Hell from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health and ammo. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the "Crucible Blade" energy sword and a retractable arm-blade can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent "glory kill" executions. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with a "Meat Hook", which slingshots the player towards an enemy, functioning as a grappling hook in both combat scenarios and environmental navigation. Armaments including missiles, grenade launchers and flamethrowers can also be attached to the Doom Slayer's armor. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing and dash moves will also be introduced. &&&&& &&&&& Creative director Hugo Martin has stated there will be twice as many demon types as in the 2016 reboot. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, will be reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called "Destructible Demons" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. &&&&& &&&&& The game will feature an asymmetric multiplayer mode called "Invasion", in which players can join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons. This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo. In addition to Invasion, the game features other standard multiplayer modes. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& The forces of Hell have begun to invade Earth, and the Doom Slayer arrives to repel the demons. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& Publisher Bethesda Softworks announced the game at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018, with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at QuakeCon 2018. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One. In 2019, it was announced that ''Doom Eternal'' would come to Google's upcoming Stadia streaming platform. The game is being developed by id Software with the Nintendo Switch version being developed by Panic Button. Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin both returned to serve as the game's directors. &&&&& &&&&& The game is the first to be developed with the id Tech 7 engine, which features ten times the geometric detail and texture fidelity of idTech 6. According to Stratton, the team aimed at making a "''Doom'' universe", featuring larger and more varied locales, including "Hell on Earth", for players to explore. Unlike its predecessor, id Software is developing the game's multiplayer component in-house, as opposed to being outsourced to the previous game's multiplayer developer Certain Affinity, with the goal of making the experience more "social" and "connected" with the single-player campaign. The team decided to remove the SnapMap mode and reassign its resource to develop post-launch campaign downloadable content. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& ''Doom Eternal'' was nominated for "Most Wanted Game" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

GS&WR Class 362 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR) Class 362''' consisted of a six 4-6-0 locomotives designed by R. Coey and built between 1905 and 1907 for goods traffic. It was designed to be more powerful than the preceding class 355 0-6-0 and used the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement, the first design to do so in Ireland, to achieve an axle loading of under .  Engine 366 was displayed at the 1907 Dublin Exhibition. Issues included being too long for some turntables, a tendency for rough riding at speed and incidents of derailment due to lack of weight on the forward bogie. The class did not compare favourably with class 355 when the former were converted to the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement and were withdrawn by 1931. &&&&& &&&&& There is a detailed O Gauge model of engine 362 in the Fry model railway collection. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

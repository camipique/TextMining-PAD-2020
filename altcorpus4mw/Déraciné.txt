Déraciné &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Déraciné''''' is a virtual reality adventure game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game was released for the PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR accessory on November 6, 2018. Players take the role as a fairy in an isolated boarding school who attempts to solve a mystery. ''Déraciné'' was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the ''Souls'' series. It received mixed reviews from critics. &&&&& &&&&& Plot &&&&& &&&&& The Faerie awakens one night in an orphanage, and is taught by another faerie that all faeries possess a red ring on their right hand that can store life energy, and a blue ring on their left hand that can manipulate time. If a faerie possesses a golden wand, they can use it to drain a human's remaining timespan and use that time to travel to the past. &&&&& &&&&& The Faerie then meets a girl named Yuliya, who seems to be aware of the Faerie's presence. She asks the Faerie to convince the other children in the orphanage, Lorinc, Herman, Marie, Nils, and Rosza, that the Faerie exists. The Faerie goes about manipulating items and objects that convinces the other children the Faerie is real, but it also becomes evident that Yuliya had actually passed away some time ago, meaning the Yuliya speaking to the Faerie is her ghost. As the children continue to interact with the Faerie, it encounters the caretaker of the orphanage, the Headmaster. The Headmaster gives the Faerie his gold wand and asks it to take his remaining time to travel to the past and prevent the incident that crippled Rosza's leg. The Faerie does so, and upon returning to the present, Rosza's leg is healed. &&&&& &&&&& Yuliya then approaches the Faerie again and warns it that the children have left the orphanage and wandered into the forest, and pleads for the Faerie to save them. The Faerie follows the children's trail into the forest, finding out that they learned of faeries' ability to transfer the life force of one being to another. They decided to go into the forest to find something large enough that they can use to revive Yuliya. The Faerie continues on into the forest, but is too late to stop an evil faerie from draining their life force and killing them. Lorinc is the only survivor, and offers up his own life force to allow the Faerie to travel back to the past to prevent the children from venturing into the forest. &&&&& &&&&& The Faerie travels back in time and does its best to prevent or discourage the children from going into the forest. However, their desire to revive Yuliya is too strong, and they will inevitably venture into the forest and be killed by the evil faerie. The Faerie concludes that the only way to stop them is to revive Yuliya. Traveling back in time again, the Faerie finds the barely living corpse of another caretaker, Margerita, who committed suicide after the death of her daughter Alexis. Taking the red ring Margerita's corpse is wearing, the Faerie places it on Yuliya's corpse, reviving her. However, being granted another person's life force inevitably changes Yuliya into an evil faerie and she steals the life force of all of the children and the Headmaster. Regretting what she has done, Yuliya allows the Faerie to take all the life force she has gathered in order to stop what has happened. The only choice the Faerie has left is to prevent whatever killed Yuliya in the first place. &&&&& &&&&& The Faerie travels back to the night of Yuliya's death, and through more investigations, learns that the Headmaster and Margerita were scholars from the city of Rohn who were studying the nature of faeries and how to utilize their powers to improve the world. However, something went terribly wrong, as Rohn was burned down and evil faeries now run rampant through the land stealing life force indiscriminately from humans. The Headmaster and Margerita set up the orphanage to continue their experiment. Concluding that humans with past regrets will become evil when turned into faeries, the Headmaster and Margerita decide that newborn is the perfect candidate to turn into a faerie, since it would have no past regrets it would feel a need to correct. They attempted to turn Alexis into a faerie, resulting in Alexis' death and Margerita's suicide. The Faerie then comes to the realization that it is the faerie version of Alexis, summoned into being when Yuliya stole the Headmaster's golden wand and wished to see Alexis again. By wishing with the golden wand, Yuliya inadvertently traded her own life force to create the Faerie. &&&&& &&&&& At this point, the Faerie is left with three choices: never take Yuliya's life so the wish never comes to be, take Yuliya's life and remain trapped in the cycle of futilely trying to rescue the children, or take Yuliya's life and then return it to her. If the third option is chosen, Yuliya comes to the realization of how special her own life is, and resolves to live her life to the fullest. However, this means the Faerie sacrifices its own ability to interact with the world, dooming it to slowly fade away into nothing. Afterwards, Yuliya lives happily with her friends and the Headmaster. &&&&& &&&&& Development &&&&& ''Déraciné'' is virtual reality (VR) adventure game developed by FromSoftware, with production assistance from SIE Japan Studio, and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 via its PlayStation VR add-on peripheral.

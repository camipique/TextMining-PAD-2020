European Union Agency for the Space Programme &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''European Union Agency for the Space Programme''' is a proposed future agency of the European Union, based on the existing European GNSS Agency. The choice of name has been criticized by the European Space Agency for being too close to its own as well as encroaching on areas ESA believes to be its responsibility.. &&&&& &&&&& In June 2018, the European Commission proposed that the European GNSS Agency be transformed into an EU Agency for the Space Programme, with oversight of Space Situational Awareness. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *European Space Agency &&&&& *European Union Satellite Centre &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

DFSK C37 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''DFSK C37, C36, and C35''' (东风小康C37/C36/C35, dōngfēng xiǎokāng C37/C36/C35) are a range of 5-door vans manufactured by DFSK (Dongfeng Sokon), a joint venture between Dongfeng Motor and Chongqing Sokon Industry. &&&&& &&&&& Overview &&&&& The model was unveiled to the market on September 21, 2009 available as a passenger van (C37), a entry level passenger van (C36), and a panel van (C35). The C37 is larger and more roomier with a longer wheelbase when compared to the previous DFSK K series and V series microvans. Three seating configurations are available for the C37 including 2+2+3, 2+2+2+3, and 2+3+3+3 with prices ranging from RMB 46,900 to 59,800 yuan. The design of the C37 is controversial as the front DRG and side DLO graphics heavily resembles the Ford Transit van at the time despite the obvious difference in size and vehicle segment. The C35 and C37 are available in the UK market as of 2017. The brand was originally launched in the UK in 2012 but sales under the previous distributor ended before 2016. &&&&& &&&&& DFSK C36 &&&&& A cheaper version was launched later named the C36 which had a low starting price. As the base trim, the C36 misses some basic features compared to the C37 such as front fog lamps, air conditioning, airbags, and it also features steel wheels instead of alloys. &&&&& &&&&& DFSK C35 &&&&& DFSK launched the panel van or cargo van variant of the C37, the C35 later in the second half of 2012, which had configurations in 2 or 5 seats and steel-sealed windows in the side and tailgate. The C35 was only available on the market until late 2013. &&&&& &&&&& Gallery &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * on dfdongfeng.com &&&&& * on dfdongfeng.com &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

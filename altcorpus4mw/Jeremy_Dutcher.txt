Jeremy Dutcher &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Jeremy Dutcher''' is a classically-trained Canadian Indigenous tenor, composer, musicologist, performer and activist, who currently lives in Toronto, Ontario. He is most noted for his album ''Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa'', which won the 2018 Polaris Music Prize and the Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year at the 2019 Juno Awards. &&&&& &&&&& A Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) member of the Tobique First Nation in North-West New Brunswick, Dutcher studied music and anthropology at Dalhousie University. He originally trained as an operatic tenor in the Western classical tradition, and later expanded his professional repertoire to include the traditional songs of his community. He recorded ''Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa'' following a research project on old archival recordings of traditional Maliseet songs at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, many of which are no longer being passed down to contemporary Maliseet youth. &&&&& &&&&& Dutcher identifies as two-spirit. &&&&& &&&&& Discography &&&&& * ''Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa'' (2018) &&&&& &&&&& Awards and nominations &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Award &&&&& &&&&& Category &&&&& &&&&& Nominee/Work &&&&& &&&&& Result &&&&& &&&&& Ref &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2018 &&&&& &&&&& Polaris Music Prize &&&&& &&&&& Shortlisted &&&&& &&&&& ''Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa'' &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2019 &&&&& &&&&& Juno Award &&&&& &&&&& Indigenous Music Album of the Year &&&&& &&&&& ''Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa'' &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Activism &&&&& &&&&& === Indigenous Activism === &&&&& Dutcher aims to preserve both Wolastoq culture and language through his music, and inspire Indigenous youth to think about the importance of language. When asked about his decision to record in his native Wolasktoq language, Dutcher stated "it’s less about asking people to learn a new language and more about disrupting the bilingual Anglo-centric Canadian music narrative. Up until this point, why have there been no popular records in my language?" &&&&& &&&&& At the Juno Awards pre-telecast industry gala dinner on March 16, 2019, Dutcher used his acceptance speech to critique the Trudeau government's approach to reconciliation with indigenous peoples. Although his remarks were interrupted partway through when he was played off the stage, later that evening Arkells gave their own speaking time to allow him to conclude his remarks. He made his first national televised performance at the Juno Awards the following night, March 17, 2019, performing “Sakomawit” from his album “Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa" beneath black and white photographs of his Wolastoq ancestors. &&&&& &&&&& === LGBTQ2S+ Activism === &&&&& Dutcher was previously responsible for development coordination and Indigenous outreach at Egale Canada, which is currently the country's only national LGBT human rights organization. &&&&& &&&&& The intersection of identifying as both Indigenous and Two-Spirited allows Dutcher to speak out on the Indigenization of queer spaces. In the Two-Spirit Roundtable project he speaks on the lack of gendered pronouns in the Maliseet language, and advocates for a "less western" way of thinking about gender. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Due to various families, most notable of which was the Staniforth family, being mentioned in relation to the place, it is likely that Litfield was a loose term applied to the area surrounding the farmhouse. The farmhouse appears to have been in the possession of the Staniforth family for centuries. On 24 April 1587, Robert Sitwell transferred the land to Ralph Staniforth. During the 17th century, a William Staniforth is resident at the farmhouse. The farmhouse eventually was passed down to George Staniforth of Barlborough.In 1828, the property is divided following the death of George Staniforth and was sold. In 1842 the Parker family is residing at the property. &&&&& &&&&& Upon its propsed sale in 1859, the Litfield freehold estate of 30 acres consisted of the farmhouse and associated buildings, and also five cottages. &&&&& &&&&& Although the house retains most of its original features, it was renovated in 2006. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Photo of Litfield Farm on Geograph &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

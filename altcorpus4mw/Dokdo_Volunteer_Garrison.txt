Dokdo Volunteer Garrison &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Dokdo Volunteer Garrison''' (Korean: '''독도의용수비대''') was a South Korean paramilitary outpost on the islands of Liancourt Rocks, which are called ''Dokdo'' in Korean. South Korea and Japan each claim sovereignty over them. South Korea maintained the garrison from 1953 to 1956. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, plans to upgrade the outpost to a more military basis caused tension between South Korea and Japan. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& On April 20, 1953, work began to create a garrison on the islands to protect it from Japanese aggression. Completed in December 30, 1956, it was handed over to the National Police. Hong Soon-chil and other veterans of the Korean War, who returned to Ulleung Island after participating in the Korean Armed Forces volunteer service and fought in the Korean War, made up the garrison. They kept it from trespassing by Japan. It was a private organization that has laid the foundation for Korea to exercise territorial sovereignty over the islands. &&&&& &&&&& Organization &&&&& Captain Hong Soon-chul selected his troops, having regard to their combat experience, bravery, age, personality, and family situation. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& + &&&&& &&&&& Organization configuration table &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& General &&&&& &&&&& Hong Soon-chil &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Adjutant (33) &&&&& &&&&& Hwang Young-moon &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Combat 1 Captain & troops &&&&& &&&&& Seo Ki-jong (Kim Jae-doo, Choi Jae-woo, Cho Sang-dal, Kim Yong-geun, Han Jin-jin, Kim Hyun-soo, Kim Jang-ho and Yang Bong-joon) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Combat 2 Captain & troops &&&&& &&&&& Jung Won-do (Kim Yeong-bok, Kim Su-bong, Lee Sang-guk, Lee Gyu-hyun, Kim Kyung-ho, Heo Shin-do, Kim Young-ho) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Rear support captain & troops &&&&& &&&&& Byeong-Yeol Kim (Jung Jae-deok, Han Sang-yong, Park Young hee) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Educational captain & troops &&&&& &&&&& Yoo Won Sik (Oh Il Hwan, Ko Sung Dal) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Supply Captain & troops &&&&& &&&&& Kim in-Gab (Jung-Ikwan, Ahn Kwang-Ryul, Jung Hyun Kwon, Koo Yong Bok, Lee Pil-young) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& === Organization motivation === &&&&& &&&&& Japan regained its sovereignty after the allied Occupation of Japan post-World War II, through the San Francisco Peace Treaty. However, the Korean War made it difficult for Korea to focus on protecting the island when there were more pressing matters on the peninsula. Starting in 1953, Japan began to assert their claims to Liancourt Rocks. Threatening to use force, they drove out fishermen from Ulleung Island. Due to the war, Korea was unable to prepare a plan to defend Liancourt Rocks. &&&&& &&&&& After returning to Ulleungdo at the end of the war, Captain Hong Soon-chul did not return to protect Liancourt Rocks. Hong knew that it was difficult to send troops after the war. (Hong had previously been one of the soldiers in the garrison stationed on the islands.) &&&&& &&&&& Achievements &&&&& * A continuous defense of Liancourt Rocks' territorial sovereignty without interruption &&&&& * Preventing fishing activity from Japan within the waters of the island &&&&& * Permanent installation of a Korean territorial mark on Liancourt Rocks &&&&& * Active support from the government to strengthen Korean sovereignty of Liancourt Rocks &&&&& * Establishment of the basis for the installation of police of the Dokdo Guard &&&&& &&&&& === Beginning (to 1953) === &&&&& Since April 1953, talks had been underway to normalize relations between Korea and Japan. At the same time, the sovereignty over Liancourt Rocks was raised. In addition, Japanese ships, fishing boats, and training ships frequently appeared near the islands. This was considered to be a threat to local fishing, an important means of livelihood of Ulleungdo residents. &&&&& &&&&& === Development (from 1954) === &&&&& The Japanese Coast Guard dispatched a patrol boat to Liancourt Rocks. Several warning signs were deployed on the islands in May and July 1953, warning them to not approach the islands. On October 23, Japan installed their own territorial landmarks on the islands replacing the Korean ones. The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison was formed on April 20, 1953, led by Hong Soon-chil, due to the ongoing situation, to carry out security duties. &&&&& &&&&& The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison was stationed independently on Dokdo until the middle of August 1954. Since mid-August, when the government installed guard posts and lighthouses on Liancourt Rocks, they cooperated with the police officers dispatched officially in the area. In August 1954, they successfully repelled a Japanese attempt to reach Liancourt Rocks. In November of the same year, they fought against three Japanese ships supported by aircraft that also attempted to reach Liancourt Rocks. This resulted in Japanese casualties. &&&&& &&&&& === Finish (to 1956) === &&&&& On December 30, 1956, the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison handed over security work and equipment to the police, ending official garrison activity. However, nine Dokdo Volunteer Garrison members were assigned to the Ulleung Island police station as police officers and took charge of guard duty. &&&&& &&&&& A noble spiritual succession &&&&& &&&&& The garrison's presence helped South Korea to continue to maintain control of the islands, and has become a symbol of patriotism. &&&&& &&&&& === Military spirit === &&&&& The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison has inherited the spirit of military rebellion against foreign invading forces in Korean history. They were a military group voluntarily armed to fight against external aggression. The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison is the pride of Korea and has become the modern posterchild of traditional soldier spirit. In particular, it will be helpful for the younger generations in Korea with thoroughly being taught about the spirit of self-reliance, volunteerism, and the dedication that the garrison showed for homeland defense. &&&&& &&&&& === Dedication === &&&&& "What I did was just a natural affection for the people of Ulleung Island, and, to put it more broadly, it was nothing but a job to do as a citizen." The captain and member of the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison, Hong Sung-chul. He helped to defeat and repel against the illegal invasion of Liancourt Rocks by Japanese patrol boats, thereby protecting the territory. He has also made considerable efforts to develop the infrastructure on Liancourt Rocks. If it were not for the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison, it is clear that Liancourt Rocks would now virtually be under Japanese rule. &&&&& &&&&& Support &&&&& &&&&& The South Korean state provides support for the members of the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison and survivors who have made special sacrifices to defend Liancourt Rocks. &&&&& * Payment: the spouses of the members of the Garrison and the deceased receive a pension from the government &&&&& * National cemetery: the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison cemetery in Daejeon National Cemetery &&&&& * Payment as compensation for the death of members of the Garrison and their spouses &&&&& * A national day commemorating the Garrison &&&&& * The month of the Patriotic Veterans, and the Day of Comfort &&&&& * Invitation to a consolation event &&&&& &&&&& Assessment &&&&& In 1966, the South Korean government evaluated the achievements of the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison. It awarded Hong Soon-chil, the captain, a Work Merit Award. Eleven members were awarded a Defense Certificate. Dr. Yoo Ha-young of the Northeast Asian History Foundation said, "Above all, the presence of the Dokdo Volunteer Garrison has contributed to the exercise of national jurisdiction over Liancourt Rocks and the protection of the nation's territory." The Dokdo Volunteer Garrison showed that the territorial right of Liancourt Rocks belongs to Korea through effective control of the islands. They showed great activity symbolically and mentally, meaning that they raised patriotism and cultivated the self-consciousness of the nation. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

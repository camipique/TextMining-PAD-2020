Dan Soutar &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Daniel Gordon Soutar''' (1882 – 30 November 1937) was an Australian professional golfer. He pioneered professional golf in Australia, bringing his Scottish work ethic and all-round skills to bear on the game as a whole from teaching, to playing, to clubmaking and to course design. &&&&& &&&&& Writings &&&&& In 1906, Soutar penned ''The Australian Golfer'' in which he described the country's best golfers, its courses, his teaching methods and much more. Jack Pollard, writing in his 1990 book ''Australian Golf'' - the Game and the Players, describes the photographs of Soutar swinging in ''The Australian Golfer'': &&&&& "''Soutar had a long, sweeping swing, his supple wrists enabling him to take the club a long way back over his left shoulder before he hit the ball freely and gave it a full follow through. There was no jerk or hindrance in his swing and body turn, just a lovely free-flowing movement of the club. He was tall and fit, and usually wore a peaked cap or tam o’shanter.''" &&&&& &&&&& Amateur wins &&&&& *1903 Australian Amateur, New South Wales Amateur &&&&& *1904 New South Wales Amateur &&&&& &&&&& Professional wins (6) &&&&& * 1905 Australian Open, Australian PGA Championship &&&&& * 1906 Australian PGA Championship &&&&& * 1907 Australian PGA Championship &&&&& * 1910 Australian PGA Championship &&&&& * 1926 New South Wales PGA Championship &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

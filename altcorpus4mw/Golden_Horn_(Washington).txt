207	Golden_Horn_(Washington)
Golden Horn (Washington) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Golden Horn''' is a granite mountain located in Okanogan County in Washington state. It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. Golden Horn is situated north of Methow Pass at headwaters of the Methow River on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Tower Mountain, to the southeast. &&&&&  &&&&& Climate &&&&& Golden Horn is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. &&&&& &&&&& Golden Horn &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

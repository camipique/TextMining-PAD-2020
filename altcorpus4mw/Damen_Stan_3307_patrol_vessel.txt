Damen Stan 3307 patrol vessel &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The Damen Group has designed and sold the '''Damen Stan 3307 patrol vessel''' -- part of its family of Damen Stan patrol vessels of different sizes. &&&&& &&&&& Design &&&&& &&&&& The vessels employ an axe-bow, a new design that Damen claims improves seakeeping. The bow's leading edge is vertical, where most ships have a diagonal leading edge. The diagonal leading edge causes the bow to have more buoyancy when struck by a big wave, which increases the vessel's tendency to pitch and yaw. The model 3307 is and wide. &&&&& &&&&& The patrol vessel design is based on an earlier fast crew delivery vessel, commonly employed servicing offshore oil platforms. &&&&& &&&&& Operators &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& image &&&&& &&&&& operator &&&&& &&&&& firstdelivery &&&&& &&&&& numberordered &&&&& &&&&& notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& Homeland Integrated Offshore Services &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 6 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& * These privately owned patrol vessels will not mount any deck guns, but their crew will include heavily armed guards. &&&&& * They will patrol Nigeria's offshore and littoral oil fields. &&&&& * The vessels' bridges are bullet-proof, and, internally, there is another armored room for passengers to take refuge in, during an attack. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& South African Navy &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& 3 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& * Ordered to counter smuggling and illegal fishing. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

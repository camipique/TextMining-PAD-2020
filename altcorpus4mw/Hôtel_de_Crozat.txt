Hôtel de Crozat &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The Hôtel de Crozat on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris &&&&& &&&&& The '''Hôtel de Crozat''', later the '''Hôtel de Choiseul''', was a Parisian ''hôtel particulier'', constructed in 1704 to the designs of the French architect for the rich banker and art collector Pierre Crozat. It was located on the west side of the rue de Richelieu, south of its intersection with the Grand Boulevard (near today's 101 rue de Richelieu in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris). The Duke of Choiseul acquired the ''hôtel'' in 1750. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& Concert in the Hôtel de Crozat, , painting by Nicolas Lancret (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) &&&&& &&&&& The street facade was of modest width, but the property widened considerably toward the rear. A forecourt preceded the entry court with the typical U-shaped plan of flanking wings and a central ''corps de logis'' at the western end. The house received plentiful light, since it projected into the garden with three exterior facades providing garden views to the north, west, and south. The painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, whom Crozat generously supported, created four oval paintings depicting the Seasons for the dining room. Charles de La Fosse painted the vaulted ceiling with ''La Naissance de Minerve'' (''The Birth of Minerva''). The gallery on the west side of the main floor of the ''corps de logis'' had mirrors reflecting the garden like the Galerie des Glaces at Versailles. A fruit garden ran along the boulevard at the north, and there was a kitchen garden (''jardin potager'') on the other side of the boulevard, which Crozat at great expense had connected to the formal garden with a subterranean passage. &&&&& &&&&& Crozat's interest in the arts included music, and he held frequent concerts in his Paris home (as well as his country estate, the Château de Montmorency). The artist Nicolas Lancret created an oil-on-canvas sketch of one of these famous concerts, held around 1720 in the Grande Galerie overlooking the garden. The performers included a female singer and ten male musicians, playing harpsichord, bassoon, six violins, double bass, and cello. &&&&& &&&&& Choiseul &&&&& Étienne François, duc de Choiseul, acquired the ''hôtel'' by his marriage in 1750 to Louise-Honorine Crozat, daughter of Louis-François Crozat, marquis du Châtel. Choiseul made numerous enhancements to the house until it became one of the most sumptuous in Paris. The interior was depicted by the miniaturist Louis-Nicolas Van Blarenberghe on the famous Choiseul snuffbox (c. 1770–1771). The walls were covered with rather simple wood panelling, most of which was installed under the Crozats, and the parquet floors were made from exotic woods. His ''hôtel'' housed a large collection of important paintings, consisting mainly of Dutch, Flemish, and French pictures, including eight works by Rembrandt. Italian paintings inherited by his wife from her father were displayed in the Grand Gallery at their country estate, the Château de Chanteloup. &&&&& &&&&& Miniatures from the Choiseul snuffbox &&&&& &&&&& File:Choiseul box top, Bedchamber by Van Blarenberghe – FJB Watson reprint from Snowman 1966.jpg|Bedchamber (snuffbox top) &&&&& File:Choiseul box bottom, Premier Cabinet by Van Blarenberghe – FJB Watson reprint from Snowman 1966.jpg|Premier Cabinet (snuffbox bottom) &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Salle Favart &&&&& Site plan for a project by Jacquin (1781, unexecuted) for the theatre of the Opéra-Comique, now the site of the Salle Favart, showing the Hôtel de Choiseul between the rue d'Amboise on the north and the rue Neuve St. Marc on the south and a new wing closing off the former entrance court with an avant-corps facing the courtyard to its east &&&&& &&&&& Around 1780, disgraced and in financial difficulty, Choiseul decided with the help of his banker friend, Jean-Joseph de Laborde, to subdivide his property for development. The garden, reaching the boulevard to the north and bordered on the south by the ''hôtel'' of the Duchess of Gramont Béatrix de Choiseul-Stainville, became the site of the Opéra-Comique's first Salle Favart, which opened in 1783. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Bibliography &&&&& * Anonymous (1996).

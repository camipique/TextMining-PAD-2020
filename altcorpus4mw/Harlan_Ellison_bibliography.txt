For the series run, Ellison worked with many pre-eminent artists and writers to bring some of his most famous stories into the comic book format. They can be found collected in two volumes.

That title first appeared in the television show ''Babylon 5'', for which Ellison was a creative consultant: in the episode "TKO" (originally broadcast in 1994), the fictional character Susan Ivanova is seen reading and laughing at a book entitled ''Working Without a Net'' by Harlan Ellison in 2258. Ultimately, Ellison chose author Nat Segaloff to write his biography and sat down for several hours of interviews, with the understanding that Ellison would have no veto over what would be in the book. That book, ''A Lit Fuse: The Provocative Life of Harlan Ellison'', was published on July 14, 2017, by NESFA Press. &&&&& &&&&& Current publications &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The print-on-demand publishers Edgeworks Abbey and Open Road publish works by Ellison. &&&&& &&&&& ''I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream'' was included in ''American Fantastic Tales'', volume II (from the 1940s to now), edited by Peter Straub and published by the Library of America in 2009.

In addition to including "How Interesting: A Tiny Man" (previously published in "Realms of Fantasy" magazine,) it also included "'Repent, Harlequin! Said the Ticktockman", "Some Frightening Films of the Forties" (a never before reprinted essay,) an illustrated bibliography of Ellison's fiction books by Tim Richmond, an article by Robert T. and Frank Garcia on Ellisons television work, an appreciation/essay by Dark Horse Comics publisher Michael Richardson, an article about Deep Shag's audio recordings of Ellison speaking engagements by Michael Reed, a 6-page B&W gallery of covers by Leo and Diane Dillon, a two-page Neil Gaiman-drawn cartoon and an official biography. &&&&& &&&&& In March 2011, Subterranean Press released an expanded edition of ''Deathbird Stories'' featuring new introductory material, new afterwords and three additional stories (the never-before-collected "From A to Z, in the Sarsaparilla Alphabet", together with "Scartaris, June 28th", and "The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore"). &&&&& &&&&& In November 2011, Edgeworks Abbey (Ellison's personal publishing arm) and Spectrum Fantastic, published a pocket-sized gift book entitled ''Bugf#ck: The Useless Wit & Wisdom of Harlan Ellison''.

In December 2011, Edgeworks Abbey began publishing original collections and retrospectives in two different series: the Brain Movies series (which contain teleplays from Ellison's award-winning career as a screenwriter) and the Harlan 101 series (which contain reprints, and original, unpublished stories and essays, and serve as an introduction to Ellison's writings). December 1, 2011 saw the simultaneous publication of four books: ''Brain Movies: Volume One'', ''Brain Movies: Volume Two'', ''Harlan 101: Encountering Ellison'', and ''The Sound of a Scythe and Three Brilliant Novellas''. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2012, Kicks Books published ''Pulling a Train'', the first of two reprints of early writings by Ellison, originally published in pulp magazines and in paperbacks for the crime fiction market. Simultaneously, the publisher of "Deep Shag" Records released "On the Road With Ellison, Volume Six". &&&&& &&&&& In October 2012, Kicks Books published ''Getting in the Wind'', the second half of a reissue of stories originally published as ''Sex Gang'', under Ellison's Paul Merchant pseudonym in the 1950s. &&&&& &&&&& In November 2012, Edgeworks Abbey published ''None of the Above'', an unproduced screenplay adaptation (written for director Costa-Gavras) of Norman Spinrad's novel, ''Bug Jack Barron'', and ''Rough Beasts'', seventeen never-before-collected pulp stories from the 1950s. &&&&& &&&&& In April 2013, Hardcase Crime – publishers of original and reprint paperback crime fiction – published a reprint of ''Web of the City''. &&&&& &&&&& In May 2013, Edgeworks Abbey published ''Brain Movies: Volume Three'' and ''Brain Movies: Volume Four'', two further collections of Ellison's teleplays, including two unproduced pilots. &&&&& &&&&& In July 2013, DC Comics published, in hardcover, ''Harlan Ellison's 7 Against Chaos'', illustrated by Paul Chadwick. &&&&& &&&&& In November 2013, Edgeworks Abbey and HarlanEllisonbooks.com published, ''Brain Movies: Volume Five'', including a treatment for an unproduced episode of ''Batman'', an unproduced, original teleplay, "The Dark Forces", and several others.

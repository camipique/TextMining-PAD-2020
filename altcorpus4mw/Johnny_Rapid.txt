Johnny Rapid &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Johnny Rapid''' (born '''Hylan Anthony Taylor'''; August 24, 1992) is an American gay pornographic film actor. &&&&& &&&&& Since 2010, he has appeared in over 200 pornographic scenes for ''Men.com'' studio. &&&&& &&&&& Early life &&&&& Hylan Anthony Taylor was born on August 24, 1992 in Conyers, Georgia, near Atlanta. &&&&& &&&&& As a teenager, he was a fairly commonplace boy, a car enthusiast, and a boxer. He graduated from ''Rockdale District School'' in 2010. &&&&& &&&&& His studies were not really his forte, and coming from a modest background, he quickly entered the workforce and lived odd jobs. Everything changed when, at the age of eighteen, he lost his job in the middle of summer. By consulting several ads, he thought that playing in porn films could be a good way to make money quickly. &&&&& &&&&& Gay pornographic career &&&&& On his eighteenth birthday, he went to a gay pornographic studio to audition, after responding to an ad on Internet. The agents were impressed by his skills and physique, and engaged him immediately. The following Wednesday marked the beginning of his career. &&&&& &&&&& Asked to find a pseudonym, he chose ''Johnny'' ("because it's the kind of name that is easily remembered", he says) and ''Rapid'' in a nod to his boxing activities where he stood out for his responsiveness and speed: Hylan Anthony Taylor became Johnny Rapid. &&&&& &&&&& Before building his career for ''Men.com'', he also played several scenes for ''Boys First Time'' and ''Bukkake Boys'' Studios. For the first, he appeared in a scene called ''Rapid Fire'' released December 23, 2011. Another scene was filmed on January 2, 2012 and released February 17, 2012 under the title ''Dick Dance''. For ''Bukkake Boys'', he played about nine scenes that came out at the end of 2011 and in 2012. &&&&& &&&&& He then stayed at ''Men.com'' studio, where he quickly became the star actor. Over the course of his prolific career, he played in more than 200 scenes and became the highest-paid model in the gay porn industry, becoming the face and brand of ''Men.com''. &&&&& &&&&& In 2013, he played the role of Charlie David in the movie ''I'm a Porn Star'', with Brent Everett, Colby Jansen and Rocce Reed, as one of the main interviewees. He also became one of Andrew Christian's models, who creates underwear for a gay clientele. He posed for him for commercials: ''Waking Up with Johnny Rapid'' (April 2013) and ''Studburbia'' (July 2013). &&&&& &&&&& In January 2015, he received even more media coverage when ''Men.com'' publicly offered $ 2 million to Canadian singer Justin Bieber to shoot a pornographic scene with Johnny Rapid. The offer, broadcast on ''Youtube'', came shortly after the release of photos of Justin Bieber for a Calvin Klein advertising campaign. The singer never answered. &&&&& &&&&& In 2017, he was one of the most sought after actors on ''Pornhub'' website in the gay porn category. &&&&& &&&&& Private life &&&&& Discreet about his private life, Johnny Rapid previously defined himself as heterosexual, as a ''gay for pay'' actor, however he now identifies as bisexual. &&&&& &&&&& He has a daughter. &&&&& &&&&& In December 2014, he was arrested for alleged assault on his wife, who refused to organize a trio with another girl who was fourteen. He got out of jail after serving one day, paying a $Â 2,500 bail. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

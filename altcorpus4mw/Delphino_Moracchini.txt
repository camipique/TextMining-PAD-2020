Delphino Moracchini &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Delphino Moracchini''' (1846-1903) was a French colonial administrator. He served in French Guiana, French India, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. &&&&& He was appointed assistant to the Governor of Martinique in 1890, where his prompt action in responding to a fire in Fort-de-France led to his being appointed governor the next year. &&&&& He dealt efficiently with recovery from a major hurricane in 1891. &&&&& In 1895 he was transferred to Guadeloupe, where he had to deal with an earthquake, fire and hurricane. &&&&& He also found himself in the middle of a struggle between the white proprietors and the socialists, in which he managed to preserve the peace at the cost of his popularity. &&&&& &&&&& Early years &&&&& &&&&& Delphino Moracchini was born in San-Lorenzo, Corsica, in 1846. &&&&& He obtained a degree in Law, attended the Colonial School and began a career in the colonial judiciary. &&&&& In 1875 he was assigned to Cayenne, French Guiana, and from there went to French India. &&&&& In 1882 he was briefly a tax collector in Vosges, then in 1885 he was Director of the Interior, second in command to the governor, in Tahiti and then in Nouméa. &&&&& On 1 December 1885 he became acting governor of French Polynesia in place of Marie Nicolas François Auguste Morau. &&&&& He was replaced by Étienne Théodore Lacascade on 2 September 1886. &&&&& From 30 July 1888 to 20 December 1888 he was Governor of New Caledonia. &&&&& &&&&& Martinique &&&&& &&&&& In 1890 Moracchini was appointed Director of the Interior in Martinique, the second ranking official after the Governor, Germain Casse. &&&&& On 22 June 1890 a fire broke out in Fort-de-France that destroyed a large part of the city and killed 14 people. &&&&& Both the mayor and the governor were absent, so Moracchini took charge and directed the firefighters of Saint-Pierre and the army in saving as much as possible of the city. &&&&& For his prompt action he was named governor in place of Casse. &&&&& He held office from 4 February 1891 until June 1895. &&&&& &&&&& On 18 August 1891 the island was hit by a hurricane, with 450 dead and over 2,000 injured. &&&&& Moracchini managed to secure credits from metropolitan France to rebuild infrastructure and restore the economy. &&&&& Some of the hurricane relief funding was diverted to reconstruction of buildings destroyed in the 1890 fire. &&&&& The government refused to provide a requested million-franc loan or to suspend the island's debt, but did help organize donations to help the hurricane victims. &&&&& More than 791,000 francs were provided by December 1891. &&&&& &&&&& In 1894 Moracchini received Béhanzin, the exiled king of Dahomey, with his large family. &&&&& Local politicians accused him of starving the prisoner, but in fact he treated him with great humanity. &&&&& He lodged the king in Fort Tartanson at Fort de France, treating him with the respect due to his rank. &&&&& &&&&& Guadeloupe &&&&& &&&&& In June 1895 Moracchini was transferred to become Governor of Guadeloupe. &&&&& He exchanged places with Noël Pardon, who became governor of Martinique. &&&&& On 23 April 1897 an earthquake destroyed part of Pointe-à-Pitre. &&&&& That year his decision on the exchange rate made him deeply unpopular with some of the factory owners. &&&&& In 1898 there were stormy legislative elections, with Gaston Gerville-Réache and Hégésippe Légitimus elected. &&&&& Moracchini had to deal with a fire in Pointe-à-Pitre in June 1898 and a hurricane on 7 August 1899. &&&&& &&&&& In 1899 the factory and plantation owners accused the Socialists, led by Légitimus, of setting fires throughout the island, while the socialists placed the blame on the reactionary whites. &&&&& The white owners were in contact with the American consul, waiting for a chance to ask the United States to intervene. &&&&& The American fleet was cruising in the vicinity. &&&&& Moracchini steered a middle road, refusing to take actions that would make him the "dupe or accomplice of the reactionaries", and restored calm, although he made himself unpopular with both sides. &&&&& He left office on 2 June 1900. &&&&& He was promoted to Governor 1st Class in 1900, and automatically retired in 1901. &&&&& &&&&& Notes &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

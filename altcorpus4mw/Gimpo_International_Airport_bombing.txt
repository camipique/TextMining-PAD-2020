It took place just six days before the start of the 1986 Asian Games hosted by Seoul.

He also said the attack was similar to the Rangoon bombing in 1983 when dozens of South Koreans lost their lives. &&&&& &&&&& These bombings, including that of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987, caused the South Korean government to apply massive security measures for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Korean Air Flight 858 &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Let Us March Forward Dynamically Towards Final Victory, Holding Higher the Banner of Songun &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Let Us March Forward Dynamically Towards Final Victory, Holding Higher the Banner of Songun''''' () is a speech by Kim Jong-un on 15 April 2012, given to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-sung. It was his first major public speech after succeeding his father Kim Jong-il after his death in 2011. He had given at least one speech, ''Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party'', to party officials the week before. &&&&& &&&&& Kim delivered the speech at the Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang. He delivered it in 20 minutes. The speech was broadcast on North Korean television. Kim's public speech was noted for departing from the customs of his father Kim Jong-il, who spoke in public extremely rarely. A song, "Onwards Toward the Final Victory", was created on the basis of the speech. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& &&&&& *Kim Jong-un bibliography &&&&& *''Songun'' &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& ===Works cited=== &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& Further reading &&&&& * &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

He played for three different schools at the high school level, emerging as a four-star recruit and one of the top-ranked prospects in Nevada while at Desert Pines High School in Las Vegas. Despite receiving several NCAA Division I offers, he was considered academically ineligible after his grades plummeted due to the death of his sister, continuing his career at Antelope Valley College before moving to the JBA. &&&&& &&&&& High school career &&&&& Floyd began his high school years at Ed W. Clark High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, earning few minutes as a freshman, but helping his team win the Division I-A state title.

He said, "I don't really let it bring me down during the game; I use it as motivation, to do it for her. Play for her and play for my family." &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Ingvild Aleksandersen &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Ingvild Aleksandersen''' (born 1968) is a Norwegian lawyer who has been serving as the current County Governor of Finnmark county since 2016. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Ingvild Aleksandersen was born in 1968 in Vadsø in Northern Norway. She was married in 2000 to Eskil Aleksandersen. &&&&& &&&&& Education and career &&&&& Aleksandersen graduated from the University of Oslo in 1995 with a cand.jur. degree. She then worked as a lawyer in private practice, for the Finnmark Estate, and for the Finnmark County Municipality. From 2013-2016, she was the assistant county governor of Finnmark under Gov. Gunnar Kjønnøy. On 1 October 2016, she was appointed as the acting County Governor of Finnmark county. This job was considered temporary because the Government of Norway was (at that time) re-evaluating the counties in Norway and the future of Finnmark as a separate county after 2019 was uncertain. Aleksandersen will hold this post until 2019 when the neighboring counties of Troms and Finnmark will be merged. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

149	Finger_Lake_(Alaska)
Finger Lake (Alaska) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Finger Lake''' is a lake in Wasilla, Alaska. It is not technically a finger lake, but was named so by Captain Edward Glenn, who led an army expedition to Alaska in 1898 and felt that "when viewing the lake on a map, a point of land in the lake gives the impression of a finger." The lake has populations of Rainbow Trout, Arctic Char and Arctic Grayling and is a popular fishing spot, including ice fishing in winter. The lake is at the south end of the Seven-mile canoe trail that ends at Wasilla Lake, the only portage is at the north end of Finger Lake. &&&&& &&&&& Park &&&&& Regional headquarters &&&&& Alaska State Parks operates the '''Finger Lake State Recreation Area''', a park with a campground, boat launch, and picnic areas. The park also contains the regional headquarters for Matanuska-Susitna Valley area parks. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

122	Greenlandian
Greenlandian &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& In the geologic time scale, the '''Greenlandian''' is the earliest age or lowest stage of the Holocene epoch or series, part of the Quaternary. It is one of three subdivisions of the Holocene. The lower boundary of the Greenlandian Age is the GSSP sample from the North Greenland Ice Core Project in central Greenland (75.1000°N 42.3200°W). The Greenlandian GSSP has been correlated with the end of Younger Dryas (from near-glacial to interglacial) and a “shift in deuterium excess values”. &&&&& &&&&& The age began 11,700 years prior to the year 2000 (300 HE). &&&&& &&&&& The age was officially ratified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in July 2018 along with the Meghalayan and the Northgrippian. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

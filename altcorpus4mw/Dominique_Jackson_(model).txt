Although Jackson grew up with a grandmother that had "station," she still experienced a traumatic upbringing that included bullying and sexual abuse.

It was in 1993, while living in Baltimore, Maryland, that Jackson was introduced to the ballroom scene. She then lived in various "houses" and eventually settled in the House of Sinclair which was stationed in New York City. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& &&&&& === Modeling === &&&&& So that she may develop the right opportunities, Jackson did most of her early modeling work for free.

Her work on ''Strut'' earned her a GLAAD Media Award nomination. &&&&& &&&&& In 2018, Jackson began appearing in the leading role of Elektra Abundance on the FX series ''Pose'', which is based on the ballroom subculture in New York City of the late 1980s. The series premiered on June 3, 2018, and attracted critical acclaim. The first season boasted the largest cast of transgender actors ever for a scripted network series, with over 50 transgender characters. On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, which is set to premiere sometime in 2019. &&&&& &&&&& === Writing and community service === &&&&& Jackson has been open about her mental health struggles. After a thirteen-year writing process, she released her autobiography ''The Transsexual from Tobago''.

122	IDPN_(chemical)
IDPN (chemical) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''IDPN''' (3,3'-iminodipropanenitrile) is a neurotoxin with ototoxic and hepatotoxic effects. It causes irreversible movement disorder. &&&&& &&&&& Ototoxicity &&&&& IDPN has been shown to kill vestibular hair cells, disrupting normal vestibular function, in rats, mice, guinea pigs, and frogs. In rodents, the loss of vestibular function results in balance-related deficits, including circling behavior, retropulsion, and head bobbing, as well as weight loss. Type I hair cells are more sensitive to IDPN toxicity than Type II hair cells. No regeneration of vestibular hair cells was observed, thus these effects can be considered to be irreversible. &&&&& &&&&& IDPN has also been shown to kill cochlear hair cells, affecting auditory function. IDPN-induced hearing loss covered a broad range of frequencies. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

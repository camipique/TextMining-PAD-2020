Jonathan Frankel &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& '''Jonathan Frankel''' (July 15, 1935, London – May 7, 2008, Jerusalem) was a historian and writer. He was a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1964 to 1985, and a professor between 1985 and 2004. &&&&& &&&&& Influence &&&&& Jonathan Frankel was one of the most influential historians of Modern Jewry, as testified in many obituaries: “the most highly regarded historian of modern Jewry of his generation” (Steven Zipperstein, ''The Independent''); “arguably the greatest historian of modern Jewry of his generation” (''The Times''); “a brilliant historian of Russian and Jewish history” (David Cesarani, ''The Guardian'',). &&&&& Jonathan Frankel’s most influential contribution to the historiography of East European Jewish life is his book ''Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862–1917'' (1982), which became a classic at the moment of its publication. In this huge work Frankel approached Jewish history of the nineteenth and early twentieth century from completely a new perspective. He interconnected things which had hitherto been separate and examined them in all their complexity. He crossed the established geographical and chronological boundaries of research and produced a comprehensive image of Jewish socialism on three continents and in two generations. The translation of the book into Hebrew, Italian and Russian (the last one published just a few months before his &&&&& death) can be seen as unquestionable mark of the highest recognition. &&&&& &&&&& Family &&&&& Frankel married Edith Rogovin in 1963; they have two daughters. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Books &&&&& &&&&& * ''Vladimir Akimov on the Dilemmas of Russian Marxism 1895-1903: The Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party''.

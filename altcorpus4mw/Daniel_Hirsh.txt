''I See (You See)'' was a one-act play starring five actors, one of which would be audience-voted to strap a video camera to their head while playing out suggestions for improvisational scenes. The piece, mostly comic, was met with positive reception. &&&&& &&&&& Hirsh's most notable performance was his portrayal of '''Sir Vashya Shontine''' in Tennessee Williams' one-act play, ''Me, Vashya,'' written in 1937 during the playwright's short tenure at Washington University. The complete script was later published in the compilation ''The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays'' by publisher New Directions. ''Me, Vashya'' was performed as a World Premiere production with The Glass Menagerie as part of the Washington University in St Louis '''Tennessee Williams Symposium''' in February 2004. &&&&& &&&&& Hirsh's third World Premiere production, '''''Six Seconds in Charlack,''''' by Washington University alumni '''Brian Golden''' premiered on April 28 of 2005. ''Charlack'' was later performed on New York City's Off-Off-Broadway circuit at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center in August 2009. &&&&& &&&&& '''Theatrical Performances''' &&&&& &&&&& *''The Wizard and the Shepherdess'' (1998) as Narrator &&&&& *''All in the Timing'' (2001) as Don &&&&& *''Alice in Wonderland'' (2002) as Humpty Dumpty &&&&& *''Once in a Lifetime'' (2002) as Herman Glogauer &&&&& *''I See (You See)'' (2003) as Himself &&&&& *''All's Well That Ends Well'' (2003) as Parolles &&&&& *''Guys & Dolls'' (2003) as Nathan Detroit &&&&& *''School for Wives'' (2003) as The Notary &&&&& *''Me, Vashya'' (2004) as Sir Vashya Shontine &&&&& *''Cabaret'' (2004) as Herr Schultz &&&&& *''Downsize'' (2004) as Walter &&&&& *''The Fantasticks'' (2004) as El Gallo &&&&& *''Six Seconds in Charlack'' (2005) as Scoop and TSA Officer &&&&& *''Tick, Tick... Boom!'' (2005) as Stephen Sondheim &&&&& &&&&& '''Theatrical Directorial Experience''' &&&&& * ''Tick, Tick... Boom!'' (2005) &&&&& * ''A Shave'' (World Premiere, 2006) &&&&& &&&&& ''Tick, Tick... Boom!'' was Hirsh's first major directorial debut after Washington University secured the rights from the estate of Jonathan Larson to be the third venue in the world to produce the little-known rock musical. &&&&& &&&&& ''A Shave'' was the first of a World Premiere site-specific trilogy of plays written by student '''Lauren Dusek''' and inspired by the on-campus success of ''Downsize'' by Chicago playwright Christopher Welzenbach. '''''Downsize''''' was staged at Washington University's '''Mallinkrodt Center''' Men's Bathroom, with a maximum of only 11 or 12 audience members viewing the show at a time. The trilogy, consisting of ''A Shave,'' ''A Haircut'' and ''A Song,'' was staged in the Washington University Small Group Housing parking lot, an on-campus apartment, and a racquetball court in the Athletic Complex, respectively. &&&&& &&&&& Biographical Film &&&&& Hirsh on the set of "3 Cats and a Man" in 2011. &&&&& Following a divorce from '''Aline Gray''' in 2009, filmmaker Parthiban Shanmugam proposed the creation of a biographical film starring Hirsh and Atlanta singer/songwriter '''Debbie Aviva Kessler.''' The film's style would mimic ''My Dinner With Andre'', in which the bulk of the picture was a completely improvised conversation between the two main characters, as well as footage from Hirsh and Gray's actual wedding, with a subsection devoted to Primal Therapy as the film's penultimate sequence. ''3 Cats and a Man'' screened only once on May 17, 2012 in France. Unhappy with the outcome, Shanmugam had the film re-edited and retitled ''Pikuach Nefesh: Saving Daniel'' in 2016. The latter gained more attention due to Shanmugam's burgeoning social media presence, and was released through Amazon Prime Video in 2017. The film received generally negative critical reviews, with one user commenting, ''"Daniel is not a particularly interesting person, in fact he is pretty boring,"'' and another, ''"The characters are odd, and I didn't find myself liking either of them. More like feeling sorry for them. I give the main character credit for loving the film "Harold and Maude," though."'' &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

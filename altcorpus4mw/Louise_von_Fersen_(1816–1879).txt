Louise von Fersen (1816–1879) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Hedvig Wilhelmina Augusta Sofia Maria Teresia Lovisa von Fersen''' (18 March 1816, Stockholm – 29 December 1879, Stockholm) was a Swedish countess and heiress, and the last member of the von Fersen family. She was one of the greatest heirs of 19th-century Sweden and became notorious for the scandal of her and her husband's great bankruptcy, having wasted a fortune of about eight million ''riksdaler'' on an expensive lifestyle and gambling. &&&&& &&&&& Life &&&&& Louise von Fersen was the daughter of Fabian von Fersen (1762–1818) and Louise Piper and thus niece of Axel von Fersen the Younger.

When her youngest brother Gustaf Hans von Fersen, a known rake, died "totally décrépit" in 1839, he had three daughters with the ballerina Carolina Brunström, but no children in his three year old marriage with countess Sofie Bonde, and the entire von Fersen fortune and all of the estates within it was thereby inherited by Louise von Fersen. Among her inheritance was included the estates Mälsåker House, Ljung Castle, Steninge Palace, Fersen Palace and Finnåker. &&&&& &&&&& Louise von Fersen and her husband were known for their luxurious and expensive lifestyle. They were particularly known for their gambling trips to the casinos of Bad Homburg, Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden.

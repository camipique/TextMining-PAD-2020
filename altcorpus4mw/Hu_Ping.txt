Hu Ping &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Hu Ping''' (胡萍) (1910-?) was a Chinese actress, screenwriter and filmmaker from Hunan, China, born in Changsha.

She went to Hong Kong after the Japanese invaded in 1937, but was unable to work. She found love and lived as a celebrity, "doing nothing every day, enjoying a leisurely life, going out to the karaoke, ballroom, cafe, singing, dancing." After the Japanese took Hong Kong in 1941, she fled to Chongqing. There was a rumor that she reluctantly married the commander of the Kuomintang troops in the Yunnan, a second wife, and was beaten and locked up after trying to flee, possibly committing suicide. The Encyclopedia Baidu said that she "was in a shadow, so few people knew her whereabouts" but that she was discovered in Changsha (where she was born) during the Cultural Revolution. &&&&& &&&&& Hu Ping on the cover of The Young Companion also known as the Liangyou pictorial, issue 67 in 1932. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& Hu Ping was working in a Changsha coffee shop when she was discovered by Chinese playwright Tian Han.

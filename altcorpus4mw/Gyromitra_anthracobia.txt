Gyromitra anthracobia &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''''Gyromitra anthracobia''''' is a post-fire ascomycete fungus in the family Discinaceae. It was described as new to science in 2018 from recently burned forests on the island of Cyprus. &&&&& &&&&& This fungus can strongly resemble a ''Verpa'' species in the field, because of its smooth, hollow and distinctly elongated stipe, which is attached to the pileus only at the apex. Its cerebriform (brain-like) pileus, brown-pigmented paraphyses and biguttulate cyanophilic spores, are all typical gyromitroid features, however. &&&&& &&&&& Because of its carbonicolous ecology and isolated phylogenetic position within the ''Gyromitra'', ''G. anthracobia'' was placed in the new subgenus ''Pseudoverpa'' by Crous and colleagues (2018). &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Gundagai railway station &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Gundagai railway station ''' is a heritage-listed former railway station on the Tumut railway line at Gundagai, Cootamundra-Gundagai Regional Council, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by John Whitton. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Following 20 years of community and political representation the station was officially opened on 21 July 1886. It was designed by John Whitton, the Engineer-in-Chief of the New South Wales Government Railways. In 1903 the branch line was extended to Tumut, following the completion of the railway bridge across the Murrumbidgee River flood plain. &&&&& &&&&& The precinct environment is probably unique in railway terms in that it is sited on the side of a hill formation above a flood plain and the rail track access and the goods yard have been built by rock excavation into the hillside. This has resulted in a somewhat restricted site compared to the normal railway yard, particularly in view of the original intention for this station to be the terminus for the line. &&&&& &&&&& In 1926 the western linked part was rebuilt to provide facilities for the Refreshment Room. In 1927 alterations to provide ladies waiting room. &&&&& &&&&& For 98 years it was the hub of Gundagai's existence carrying freight, passengers and mail to and from the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. &&&&& &&&&& Following damaging floods in 1984 the branch line was closed and in 1989 the State Rail Authority abandoned the building. In 1994 Gundagai Historic Bridges Inc. was granted a 25-year lease of the disused and vandalized station and precincts. &&&&& &&&&& The station complex was significantly refurbished in the 1990s. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& &&&&& The main passenger station building is a large timber framed and weatherboard clad single storey structure with verandahs to each main elevation and brick chimneys. It is a type 4 standard roadside station design, and dates from 1886. &&&&& &&&&& The former signal box is a small timber framed and weatherboard clad building with a skillion roof constructed to house the track signalling control equipment, including an interlocking machine. It is situated on the platform. &&&&& &&&&& The goods shed is a standard side platform-type timber framed corrugated iron goods shed with iron bracketed roof eaves. It is of a sub type 3 design, and its dimensions are 72' x 22'. Its gabled roof is slated (not iron) and is very unusual in New South Wales. It stands on a brick base with timber platforms and extended line platforms leading to the pillar crane. &&&&& &&&&& The crane is a T151 5 tonne jib crane. &&&&& &&&&& All buildings were reported to be in good condition as at 27 November 2000, except for part of goods shed in fair to poor condition. &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& Gundagai is a highly significant site being the first crossing of the Murrumbidgee River by the Hume highway. There is an excellent group of railway buildings and items here from the late 1880s. In particular the relationship of the station, yard and timber road and rail viaducts makes the site of particular significance. The quality of the buildings also reflects the importance of the location at the time of the railway opening. The completeness of the site and its picturesque setting overlooking the valley add to the quality of the site and display how the railway was integrated into the existing environment and townscape.

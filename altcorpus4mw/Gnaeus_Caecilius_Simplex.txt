Gnaeus Caecilius Simplex &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Gnaeus Caecilius Simplex''' was a Roman senator, who was active during the middle of the first century AD. The ephemeral emperor Vitellius appointed him consul during the Year of Four Emperors with Gaius Quinctius Atticus as his colleague, replacing Martius Macer and Quinctius Atticus. Many believed Simplex had bribed Vitellius to be appointed to this magistracy, and he was accused of this in the Senate; however Vitellius defended Simplex, and "afterwards bestowed on Simplex a consulship that had not been bought with crime or money." &&&&& &&&&& His first known office was as governor of Sardinia, which at the time was a public province; he held this office in the term 67/68. During his consulate in the last two months of the year 69, Simplex is recorded for two acts. The first was being in charge of recording the names of volunteers wanting to join Vitellius' army against the forces of Vespasian. The second, on the morning of 18 December of the same year, was to refuse to accept Vitellius' dagger when he attempted to give it away as a form of resigning the office of emperor. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

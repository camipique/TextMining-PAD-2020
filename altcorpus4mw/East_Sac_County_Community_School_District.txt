East Sac County Community School District &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''East Sac County Community School District''' is a school district headquartered in Lake View, Iowa. The district covers portions of Sac County as well as portions of Carroll and Crawford counties. It serves Lake View, Sac City, and Wall Lake. &&&&& &&&&& it has about 1200 students. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& It was established on July 1, 2011 from the merger of the Sac Community School District and the Wall Lake View Auburn Community School District. In 2007 the districts, prior to their legal merger, had established a grade-sharing program in which each district sent students to the other district for certain educational levels; it was under the name "East Sac Schools." &&&&& &&&&& Keven Fiene served as superintendent until April 2014, when he got a job with the Interstate 35 School District. East Sac asked the South Central Calhoun Community School District if it could share a superintendent, but South Central Calhoun declined the offer. Barb Kruthoff, who had previously been superintendent of the Wall Lake View Auburn district and then also of the Sac district when the two did the grade sharing program, became the interim superintendent in June of that year. &&&&& &&&&& Schools &&&&& Schools include: &&&&& * East Sac County High School (9-12) - Lake View &&&&& * East Sac County Middle School (6-8) - Sac City &&&&& * East Sac County Elementary Sac City (PK-5) &&&&& * East Sac County Elementary Wall Lake (PK-5) &&&&& &&&&& Other facilities: &&&&& * Flex Ed Center - Sac City &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * East Sac County Community School District &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

Jeremy Rickard &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Jeremy Rickard, Oberwolfach 2006 &&&&& &&&&& '''Jeremy Rickard''', also known as '''J. C. Rickard''' or '''J. Rickard''', is a British mathematician who deals with algebra and algebraic topology. &&&&& Rickard received his PhD in 1988 from University College London Aedan Schofield. He is a professor at the University of Bristol. &&&&& &&&&& He deals with modular representation theory of finite groups and related questions of algebraic topology, representation theory of finite algebras and homologous algebra. Rickard or derived equivalences as a generalization of Morita equivalences of rings and algebras are named after him. &&&&& &&&&& In 2002, he received the Senior Berwick Prize , received an Invited Speaker at the Mathematician Congress in Berlin (''The abelian defect group conjecture''). &&&&& &&&&& Writings &&&&& * "Derived categories and stable equivalence", J.

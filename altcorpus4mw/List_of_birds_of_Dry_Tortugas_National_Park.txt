List of birds of Dry Tortugas National Park &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& This is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species recorded in Dry Tortugas National Park, which is in the U.S. state of Florida. Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS list contains 297 species as of February 2004; 15 more have been added through eBird between that date and June 2018. &&&&& &&&&& This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the ''Check-list of North American Birds'', 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the ''Check-list''. &&&&& &&&&& The NPS checklist notes the abundance of each species by season. These status codes have been used to annotate some species; those without a tag are typically observed at least 11 times in at least one season. &&&&& &&&&& *(R) '''Rarely observed''' - a species found six to 10 times in the season with the most records &&&&& *(O) '''Occasionally observed''' - a species found one to five times in the season with the most records &&&&& *(B) '''Breeding''' - a species known to breed in the park &&&&& *(B?) '''Possibly breeding''' - a species whose breeding status is unknown &&&&& *(I) '''Introduced''' - a species that has been introduced to North America by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly, and has become established in Florida &&&&& *(E) '''Extinct''' - a recent bird that no longer exists &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ducks, geese, and waterfowl &&&&& Bufflehead &&&&& '''Order''': Anseriformes'''Family''': Anatidae &&&&& &&&&& The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

(O) &&&&& *Black-billed cuckoo, ''Coccyzus erythropthalmus'' (R) &&&&& *Smooth-billed ani, ''Crotophaga ani'' (B?) (R) &&&&& &&&&& Nightjars and allies &&&&& Chuck-will's-widow &&&&& '''Order''': Caprimulgiformes'''Family''': Caprimulgidae &&&&& &&&&& Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. &&&&& &&&&& *Lesser nighthawk, ''Chordeiles acutipennis'' (O) &&&&& *Common nighthawk, ''Chordeiles minor'' &&&&& *Antillean nighthawk, ''Chordeiles gundlachii'' (R) &&&&& *Chuck-will's-widow, ''Antrostomus carolinensis'' &&&&& *Eastern whip-poor-will, ''Antrostomus vociferus'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Swifts &&&&& '''Order''': Apodiformes'''Family''': Apodidae &&&&& &&&&& The swifts are small birds, spending most of their lives flying. They have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. &&&&& &&&&& *Black swift, ''Cypseloides niger'' (One record; not on the official Florida Ornithological Society list) &&&&& *Chimney swift, ''Chaetura pelagica'' &&&&& &&&&& Hummingbirds &&&&& Ruby-throated hummingbird &&&&& '''Order''': Apodiformes'''Family''': Trochilidae &&&&& &&&&& Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. &&&&& &&&&& *Ruby-throated hummingbird, ''Archilochus colubris'' &&&&& *Black-chinned hummingbird, ''Archilochus alexandri'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Rails, gallinules, and coots &&&&& Purple gallinule &&&&& '''Order''': Gruiformes'''Family''': Rallidae &&&&& &&&&& The Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive, making them difficult to observe. Most have strong legs with long toes, short rounded wings, and are weak fliers. &&&&& &&&&& *Black rail, ''Laterallus jamaicensis'' (O) &&&&& *Clapper rail, ''Rallus crepitans'' (O) &&&&& *King rail, ''Rallus elegans'' (O) &&&&& *Virginia rail, ''Rallus limicola'' (O) &&&&& *Sora, ''Porzana carolina'' &&&&& *Purple gallinule, ''Porphyrio martinicus'' &&&&& *Common gallinule, ''Gallinula galeata'' (B?) (O) &&&&& *American coot, ''Fulica americana'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Limpkin &&&&& '''Order''': Gruiformes'''Family''': Aramidae &&&&& &&&&& The limpkin is an odd bird that looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America, and southern Florida. &&&&& &&&&& *Limpkin, ''Aramus guarauna'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Cranes &&&&& '''Order''': Gruiformes'''Family''': Gruidae &&&&& &&&&& Cranes are large, tall birds with long legs and long necks. Unlike the similar-looking but un-related herons, cranes fly with necks extended. Most have elaborate and noisy courtship displays or "dances". When in a group, they may also "dance" for no particular reason, jumping up and down in an elegant manner, seemingly just for pleasure or to attract a mate. &&&&& &&&&& *Sandhill crane, ''Antigone canadensis'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Stilts and avocets &&&&& '''Order''': Charadriiformes'''Family''': Recurvirostridae &&&&& &&&&& Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts.

Their plumage is largely gray or black and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. &&&&& &&&&& *Pacific loon, ''Gavia pacifica'' (O) &&&&& *Common loon, ''Gavia immer'' (R) &&&&& &&&&& Southern storm-petrels &&&&& '''Order''': Procellariiformes'''Family''': Oceanitidae &&&&& &&&&& The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. &&&&& &&&&& *Wilson's storm-petrel, ''Oceanites oceanicus'' (R) &&&&& &&&&& Northern storm-petrels &&&&& '''Order''': Procellariiformes'''Family''': Hydrobatidae &&&&& &&&&& Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. &&&&& &&&&& *Band-rumped storm-petrel, ''Oceanodroma castro'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Petrels and shearwaters &&&&& '''Order''': Procellariiformes'''Family''': Procellariidae &&&&& &&&&& The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized "true petrels", characterized by united tubular nostrils with a median septum. &&&&& &&&&& *Black-capped petrel, ''Pterodoma hasitata'' (O) &&&&& *Cory's shearwater, ''Calonectris diomedea'' (O) &&&&& *Sooty shearwater, ''Ardenna griseus'' (O) &&&&& *Audubon's shearwater, ''Puffinus lherminieri'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Frigatebirds &&&&& '''Order''': Suliformes'''Family''': Fregatidae &&&&& &&&&& Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. &&&&& &&&&& *Magnificent frigatebird, ''Fregata magnificens'' (B) &&&&& &&&&& Boobies and gannets &&&&& Northern gannet &&&&& '''Order''': Suliformes'''Family''': Sulidae &&&&& &&&&& The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies.

Their feet are four-toed and webbed. &&&&& &&&&& *Double-crested cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax auritus'' &&&&& &&&&& Anhingas &&&&& '''Order''': Suliformes'''Family''': Anhingidae &&&&& &&&&& Anhingas, also known as darters or snakebirds, are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, straight beaks. They are fish eaters, diving for long periods, and often swim with only their neck above the water, looking rather like a water snake. &&&&& &&&&& *Anhinga, ''Anhinga anhinga'' (O) &&&&& &&&&& Pelicans &&&&& '''Order''': Pelecaniformes'''Family''': Pelecanidae &&&&& &&&&& Pelicans are very large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. Like other birds in the order Pelecaniformes, they have four webbed toes. &&&&& &&&&& *American white pelican, ''Pelecanus erythrorhynchos'' (O) &&&&& *Brown pelican, ''Pelecanus occidentalis'' (B) &&&&& &&&&& Bitterns, herons, and egrets &&&&& Cattle egret &&&&& '''Order''': Pelecaniformes'''Family''': Ardeidae &&&&& &&&&& The family Ardeidae contains the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons are large and egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or "cow bird" is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even the head of the animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve. &&&&& &&&&& *American bittern, ''Botaurus lentiginosus'' (O) &&&&& *Least bittern, ''Ixobrychus exilis'' (R) &&&&& *Great blue heron, ''Ardea herodias'' &&&&& *Great egret, ''Ardea alba'' &&&&& *Snowy egret, ''Egretta thula'' &&&&& *Little blue heron, ''Egretta caerulea'' &&&&& *Tricolored heron, ''Egretta tricolor'' &&&&& *Reddish egret, ''Egretta rufescens'' (O) &&&&& *Cattle egret, ''Bubulcus ibis'' &&&&& *Green heron, ''Butorides virescens'' (B?) &&&&& *Black-crowned night-heron, ''Nycticorax nycticorax'' (R) &&&&& *Yellow-crowned night-heron, ''Nyctanassa violacea'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Ibises and spoonbills &&&&& '''Order''': Pelecaniformes'''Family''': Threskiornithidae &&&&& &&&&& The family Threskiornithidae includes the ibises and spoonbills.

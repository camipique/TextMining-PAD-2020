Georgie Wood &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''Georgie Wood''' (born 8 September 1993) is a British grasstrack and speedway rider. He currently rides for Eastbourne Eagles in the SGB Championship and for Isle of Wight Warriors in the National League. &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& ===2015 season=== &&&&& Wood began speedway racing in 2015, signing for Eastbourne Eagles as one of their reserves after the team dropped down to the National League that season. During the season he increased his starting 3.00 to 5.90 and moved out of the reserve position, after sitting August out with ligament damage to his knee, to ride at number 2. Riding at number 2 he scored his first paid-maximum from 4 rides getting 11+1 on 12 September in a National Trophy fixture against Mildenhall Fen Tigers. Wood helped the Eagles win a National League treble, with team winning the Knockout Cup, Gold Cup and National Trophy. &&&&& &&&&& ===2016 season=== &&&&& It was confirmed on 17 November 2015 that Wood would ride again for Eastbourne in the 2016 season after a very successful first season. He had another good season again increasing his average up to 7.62, spending most of the season riding as a heat-leader at number 3 or number 4. Wood again won the Knockout Cup with the Eagles defeating Birmingham Brummies in the final. &&&&& &&&&& ===2017 season=== &&&&& ====Eastbourne==== &&&&& Wood signed for Eastbourne for the third season in a row on 17 November 2016, and he was also named team captain for the 2017 season. In July, Wood made it to the top of the Eastbourne's averages meaning that he would ride at number 1 for the first time. He lost his place at number 1 to Jake Knight at the end of the month. He scored his first full maximum getting 18 points from 6 rides in the National League play-off semi-final against Kent Kings. Wood finished the season with an average of 7.61, which was a slight decrease to his starting average but this was understandable with him riding at the much trickier position of number 5 for most of the season. He also helped Eastbourne win the Knockout Cup for the third successive season beating Mildenhall Fen Tigers in the final. &&&&& &&&&& ====Sheffield==== &&&&& Due to his impressive start to the season with Eastbourne, on 19 July, Sheffield Tigers signed Wood as a replacement for the injured Nathan Stoneman at reserve with a starting average of 2.00. Georgie finished the season with an average of 2.31 and Sheffield won the SGB Championship beating Ipswich Witches in the play-off final. He also recorded his best heat win to date beating, former British Speedway Champion, Danny King in heat 7 of the promotion/relegation meeting against Leicester Lions. &&&&& &&&&& ===2018 season=== &&&&& ====Eastbourne==== &&&&& On 21 December 2017, it was announced that Wood would ride for Eastbourne for the fourth successive season in the National League. He started in the number 5 position but after another great start to the season saw him regain the number 1 race jacket after the first new set of averages were released. Wood lost the number 1 position to Tom Brennan for the month of July, but retook it in September, he stayed in it for the remainder of the season. For the fourth consecutive season Wood won the Knockout Cup with Eastbourne defeating Mildenhall Fen Tigers in the final. He also helped Eastbourne win their first league title in 18 years by winning the National League Play-Off Final against Mildenhall Fen Tigers. &&&&& &&&&& ====Sheffield==== &&&&& Wood didn't start the season in the Sheffield septet, however with the Tigers having a poor start to the season and with Wood on top form for Eastbourne, Sheffield decided to make team changes. This saw Wood and Broc Nicol come into the side, on 20 June, to replace Jack Smith and Jan Graversen respectively. Wood gave up his Championship place, on 27 July, to focus on his racing with Eastbourne, he was replaced in the Sheffield side by Joe Lawlor. &&&&& &&&&& ===2019 season=== &&&&& ====Eastbourne==== &&&&& Wood joined Eastbourne again for a fifth season in a row, on 6 December 2018, continuing with them with their move up to the SGB Championship. &&&&& &&&&& ====Isle of Wight==== &&&&& With Eastbourne going up into the Championship, Wood needed to find a new National League club. It was announced on 16 December 2018 that he had signed for the Isle of Wight Warriors. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

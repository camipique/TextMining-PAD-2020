Hesselin Madonna &&&&& Introduction &&&&& 300px &&&&& The '''''Hesselin Madonna''''' (French - ''La Vierge Hesselin'', ''La Vierge à l'enfant Hesselin'' or ''La Madone Hesselin'') or '''''Madonna of the Oak Cutting''''' (''La Vierge au rameau de chêne'') is a c.1640-1645 oil on canvas painting produced by Simon Vouet for the Paris house of Louis XIII's secretary Louis Hesselin. Its history between then and 1904 is unknown - that year it was exhibited in a gallery in London. In 2004 it was bought for the Louvre (where it still hangs) thanks to a business patron. &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& *http://www.latribunedelart.com/la-vierge-hesselin-de-simon-vouet-entre-au-louvre-grace-au-mecenat-d-entreprise &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

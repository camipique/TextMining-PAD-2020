Diamond Island (Myanmar) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Diamond Island''', now '''Thamihla Kyun''' (; lit. "Beautiful Daughter Island"), is off the coast of Burma at . It is in the Ayeyarwady Region and off Cape Negrais, which is also known as Pagoda Point or Mawdin Zoon, and marks the entrance to the Bassein River. &&&&& &&&&& The island is the site of an active navigational light on a skeletal tower. &&&&& &&&&& The island is a nesting place for green and loggerhead turtles. It is now one of the major nesting areas for Green turtles in Myanmar, and since 1986 there has been a conservation station on the island. In recent years the loss of mangroves has reduced turtle nesting sites. Cyclone Nargis, 2â€“3 May 2008, also damaged turtle nests and nesting sites. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& &&&&& In 1801 the British merchant ship ''Mermaid'' wrecked on a rock some miles from the island. On 7 November 1808 the East Indiaman did so also. &&&&& &&&&& A communications station, now closed, was established there. The station in 1908 was in radio contact with the Andaman Islands and had a telegraph connection to Bassein (now Pathein). &&&&& &&&&& During World War II, in January 1942 the river steamer evacuated the British radio operators on the island. On 6 March 1943, B-24s strafed the radio station while returning from an attack on shipping at Pagoda Point. &&&&& &&&&& Citations and references &&&&& '''Citations''' &&&&& &&&&& '''References''' &&&&& *''Imperial Gazetteer of India: Provincial Series'', (1908), Volume 10, (Superintendent of Government Printing). &&&&& *''Wireless Telegraph stations of the World'' (1912).

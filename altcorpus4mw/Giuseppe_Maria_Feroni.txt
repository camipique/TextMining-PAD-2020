Giuseppe Maria Feroni &&&&& Introduction &&&&& '''Giuseppe Maria Feroni''' (born 1693, died 1767) was a Cardinal in the Roman Catholic church, and camerlengo from 1760â€“1761. &&&&& &&&&& Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Feroni. &&&&& A famous bust of him by Andre-Jean Lebrun is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. &&&&& &&&&& Biography &&&&& Feroni came from the wealthy noble family of the Marquises of Bellavista. He was the son of Marchese Fabio Feroni and Costanza della Stufa. &&&&& &&&&& He studied at the Collegio Clementino in Rome, the Pontifical Diplomatic Academy, and La Sapienza University, where in 1716 he was awarded his doctorate. On January 16, 1716, he entered the Roman prelature as a candidate for the Apostolic Protonotary, and on January 23 of the same year he became a clerk at the Apostolic Signatura. &&&&& &&&&& He was ordained a priest on October 22, 1719. Pope Clement XI appointed him to be a canon of the Lateran Basilica. He was appointed a titular archbishop on May 10, 1728. Pope Benedict XIII appointed him a bishop on May 30, 1728 in St. Peter's Basilica. His Co-Consecrators were Francesco Scipione Maria Borghese, Titular Archbishop of ''Traianopolis'', and Nicola Saverio Santamaria, Titular Bishop of Cyrene. &&&&& &&&&& In the consistory of November 26, 1753, he was appointed cardinal priest and was installed on December 10, 1753 as Titular Archbishop of Damascus in the titular church ''San Pancrazio''. He participated in the Conclave of 1758, which chose Pope Clement XIII. &&&&& &&&&& From January 28, 1760 to February 16, 1761 he was Camerlengo of the College of Cardinals. After the death of Cardinal Fortunato Tamburini on August 9, 1761, Feroni became prefect of the Congregation of the Holy Rite. On December 17, 1764 he received the titular church ''Santa Cecilia'' as his see. In the fall of 1765 he moved to Siena, where he was abbot of the Abbey of San Galgano. (By that time, the abbey was already in decline, so this was probably his retirement home.) &&&&& &&&&& Feroni died on 15 November 1767 in Rome of a kidney disease. His final resting place with an elegant tomb is in his titular church ''Santa Cecilia in Trastevere''. &&&&& &&&&& Sources &&&&& &&&&& * (for Chronology of Bishops) &&&&& * FIU website article.

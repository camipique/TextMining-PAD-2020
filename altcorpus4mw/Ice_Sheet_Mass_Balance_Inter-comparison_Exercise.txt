Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise &&&&& Introduction &&&&& The '''Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise''' (IMBIE) is an international scientific collaboration attempting to improve estimates of the amounts of ice contained in ice sheets around the world and of their contribution to sea level rise and to publish data and analyses concerning these subjects. IMBIE was founded in 2011 and is a collaboration between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States. &&&&& &&&&& See also &&&&& *Marine ice sheet instability &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Web site: imbie.org &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

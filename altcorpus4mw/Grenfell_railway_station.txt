The railway station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. &&&&& &&&&& Description &&&&& The heritage-listed complex includes a type 16 station building, built in the Pioneer sub-type 2 and class A6 design, that was completed in 1901. A goods shed, or side shed, was also completed in 1901. The platform face is timber with consolidated earth. The turntable is a Sellers 1072 type.

The goods shed is now used as a Men's shed, a place for local men to get together. Grenfell had the normal facilities for a terminus station, including a station building, turntable, ash pit, coal stage and water tank. The yard was rationalised in 1985, which saw the removal of the engine servicing facilities and the turntable. &&&&& &&&&& Heritage listing &&&&& As at 27 November 2000, the station building was probably the finest extant example of a pioneer terminus station with timber platform face, it is in fair condition and suitable for adaptive re-use.

It is one of the very few remaining locomotive facilities in the state. &&&&& &&&&& Grenfell railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. &&&&& &&&&& '''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' &&&&& &&&&& This item is assessed as historically rare.

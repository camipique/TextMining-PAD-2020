Ice Skating Association of India &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Ice Skating Association of India (ISAI)''' is the national governing body for competitive ice skating disciplines, including figure skating, synchronized skating, speed skating, and short track speed skating in India. The ISAI is affiliated to the International Skating Union, and the Asian Skating Union. &&&&& &&&&& The Ice Skating Association of India was registered with the Registrar of Societies in March 2002 based on the advice of Randhir Singh, Secretary General of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and then IOA President Suresh Kalmadi. Prior to the establishment of the ISAI, the sport was governed by the Winter Games Federation of India as it was a winter sport. The IOA felt that the creation of a separate national federation would help encourage the growth of the sport in the country. &&&&& &&&&& The ISAI operates 3 indoor and 4 outdoor ice rinks in India. The three indoor rinks are located at Mumbai, Gurgaon and Raipur, Uttarakhand. The outdoor rinks are located at Gulmarg, Kargil and Leh in Jammu and Kashmir, and one in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

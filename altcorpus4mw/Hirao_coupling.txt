77	Hirao_coupling
Hirao coupling &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Hirao coupling''' (also called the '''Hirao reaction''' or the '''Hirao cross-coupling''') is the chemical reaction involving the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of a dialkyl phosphite and an aryl halide to form a phosphonate. &&&&& This reaction is named after Toshikazu Hirao and is related to the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction. In contrast to the classic Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction, which is limited to alkyl phosphonates, the Hirao coupling can also deliver aryl phosphonates. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

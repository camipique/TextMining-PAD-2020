IGTV &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& '''IGTV''' is a standalone vertical video application owned by Instagram for Android and iOS smartphones. It allows for longer videos compared to Instagram. While IGTV is available as a standalone app, basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. &&&&& &&&&& The service was launched and introduced by former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom in a live event in San Francisco on June 20, 2018, featuring different creators such as Lele Pons. &&&&& &&&&& Service &&&&& IGTV requires users to login with an Instagram account. It allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 3.6 GB. The app will automatically begin playing videos as soon as it is launched, which Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video. &&&&& &&&&& Instagram accounts with an IGTV channel receive an IGTV tab on their profile page. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

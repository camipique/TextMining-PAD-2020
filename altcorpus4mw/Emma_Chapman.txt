Her research investigates the epoch of reionization. She won the 2018 Royal Society Athena Prize. &&&&& &&&&& Early life and education &&&&& Chapman achieved first class honours for a Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in Physics at Durham University in 2010. She completed her PhD, ''Seeing the Light: Foreground Removal in the Dark and Dim Ages,'' at University College London supervised by Filipe Abdalla. She won the University College London Chris Skinner Department of Physics and Astronomy Thesis Prize. Chapman became concerned about PhD culture and how it impacts women. &&&&& &&&&& Research and career &&&&& Following her PhD, Chapman remained at University College London as a Square Kilometre Array funded postdoctoral researcher. Chapman was awarded a Royal Astronomical Society Research Fellowship in 2013. She won the Institute of Physics ''Early Career Woman Physicist of the Year Award'' in 2014. In 2018, Chapman was awarded a Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship by the Royal Society. &&&&& &&&&& Her research investigates the Epoch of Reionisation, the time in the universe when the stars began to radiate light. Chapman works with the Low-Frequency Array telescope (LOFAR). &&&&& &&&&& In 2017 Chapman was highly commended in the L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards. She is publishing her first book, ''First Light'', with Bloomsbury Publishing. She was an invited speaker at the Cheltenham Science Festival. She is speaking about the first era of stars at the 2018 ''New Scientist'' Live. &&&&& &&&&& === The 1752 group === &&&&& She has spoken about bias in science at the Royal Institution, Wellcome Collection and on the BBC. Chapman is a member of The 1752 Group, a lobbying group to end staff-student sexual harassment in academia. She was a keynote speaker on the topic at the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) International Conference for Women in Physics. She partnered with the National Union of Students (NUS) to conduct a survey of staff-student sexual harassment. They found that there was widespread misconduct in higher education and that institutions did not adequately support the victims. &&&&& &&&&& ===Awards and honours=== &&&&& In 2018, Chapman was awarded the Royal Society Athena Prize for her work to end staff-student sexual harassment and bullying in academia. &&&&& &&&&& Personal life &&&&& Chapman had her first child during the last year of her PhD. She has two children. &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

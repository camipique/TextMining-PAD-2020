Ghost Town (Kanye West song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& "'''Ghost Town'''" is a song by American rapper and producer Kanye West from his eighth studio album, ''Ye'' (2018). It features vocals from PartyNextDoor, Kid Cudi and 070 Shake. A follow-up was released by West and Cudi, as Kids See Ghosts, under the title of "Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)". The song is heavily composed around a sample of "Take Me for a Little While" by the Royal Jesters. Jungle covered it in September 2018. West performed the song, alongside Kid Cudi and 070 Shake, on the outro to the 44th season premier of ''Saturday Night Live''. It was met with strong reviews from music critics and was featured in several end of the year lists in 2018, including being listed as the number one Song of the Year by ''Genius''. The song was commercially successful, managing to chart in a total of 15 countries and achieve the certification of Gold in the US. &&&&& &&&&& Background and release &&&&& The song features vocals from PartyNextDoor. &&&&& A promotional video runs for one minute and 45 seconds on the official website of Kanye West from the ''Ye'' listening party that plays "Ghost Town" and "I Thought About Killing You". West assembled the listening party on the night before the album's release in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which is the same place that West recorded it. In an interview, featured artist 070 Shake revealed that the song was finished on the very same day that the album was released. Kevin Parker of Tame Impala initially believed that he was credited as a co-writer on the song instead of "Violent Crimes", until he was informed that "Violent Crimes" was played at the listening party. Parker had allegedly sent a number samples to West for ''Ye'', but assumed that they hadn't made the cut after not hearing back from him. The follow up to it titled "Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)" was released as part of the album ''Kids See Ghosts'' (2018) by the group Kids See Ghosts, which consists of West and Cudi, and an early tracklisting revealed that "Ghost Town" was originally supposed to be on ''Kids See Ghosts''. West revealed in June 2018 that co-writer Malik Yusef was responsible for the lyrics: "Sometimes I take all the shine/Talk like I drank all the wine". &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& The track includes a sample of "Take Me for a Little While" by the Royal Jesters within its leading bass, drum and keys combination. Whilst singing the chorus of "Ghost Town", Cudi interpolates vocals from rock and roll artist Dave Edmunds' 1979 version of "Take Me for a Little While". There is a strong presence of guitars throughout "Ghost Town". West touches on multiple subjects linked to his personal life within the song. PartyNextDoor sings the intro, which is a stream-of-consciousness riff. The outro is sung by 070 Shake, who felt crazy about being on a record with West, and laser sounds are included that resurface on Teyana Taylor's West-produced track "Issues/Hold On". &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& "Ghost Town" received strongly positive reviews from music critics. Meaghan Garvey of ''Pitchfork'' branded it as "''ye's'' clear highlight". The song was viewed by Christopher Hooton of ''The Independent'' in connection to the tracks "I Thought About Killing You" and "Yikes" as being "the only other remotely good song on ''ye''". The track's presence on the album was described by Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' as being "the one that stands on its own". Its position on the album was pointed out by Douglas Greenwood of ''NME'' as "the penultimate and perhaps strongest track", though he viewed it as what "owes a great deal to its euphoric, rocky outro provided by 070 Shake". Ed Power of ''The Irish Times'' described the track as "gorgeous and uncomplicated" and the outro as "a simple celebration – affirmative, uncomplicated and joyous". &&&&& &&&&& Accolades &&&&& The song has appeared on year-end lists by multiple publications. Its best achievement was when ''Genius'' ranked it at number one on the site's top 50 best songs of 2018 list, writing: "The song proves that no matter what Kanye West is going through, his ability to craft and curate meaningful songs is unrivaled. The song is filled with disparate elements: gospel and rock samples, a nearly unrecognizable PARTYNEXTDOOR, and the familiar sounds of Kanye and Kid Cudi's voices, topped off by radical newcomer 070 Shake." &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& +Year-end lists &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Publication &&&&& &&&&& Accolade &&&&& &&&&& Rank &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Billboard'' &&&&& &&&&&  The 100 Best Songs of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&  The Best Songs of Kanye West's Wyoming Sessions &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Genius'' &&&&& &&&&& The 50 Best Songs of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Joe'' &&&&& &&&&& The 20 Best Songs of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''NPR'' &&&&& &&&&&  The 100 Best Songs of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''The Daily Beast'' &&&&& &&&&& The 20 Best Songs of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& ''Triple J'' &&&&& &&&&& Hottest 100 of 2018 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Live performances &&&&& 070 Shake performed the song live on June 23, 2018, which marked the first time that it had been performed. On August 17, West and Kid Cudi performed it together at a surprise live show in Los Angeles. The track was performed live by West, Cudi and 070 Shake on the outro of the 44th season premier of ''Saturday Night Live'' in September 2018, and West followed the performance with a pro-Trump speech. West and Kid Cudi, as Kids See Ghosts, performed the song live as the closer to their set at the 2018 Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. A choir collaborated with West for a rendition of it during the second "Sunday Service" of his in January 2019 once West got up off a stool 36 minutes in to the performance, which included an extended outro that saw West deliver a sermon against the idea of him being cancelled. Kid Cudi brought out West to perform a rendition of the song live at the 2019 Coachella Music Festival. &&&&& &&&&& Commercial performance &&&&& In 2018, the track managed to chart in a total of 15 countries worldwide. On the week of ''Ye'' being released, the song entered the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 16 and the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at number 11. In the same week, it reached number 21 on the Canadian Hot 100. "Ghost Town" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 17 following the release of West's album. The track performed best in New Zealand by charting at number 14 on the NZ Singles Chart. It performed worst in the Netherlands, only managing to reach number 81 on the Single Top 100. &&&&& &&&&& The track was certified Gold in the US on October 23, 2018. It stands along with "Violent Crimes" as the only non-single releases from ''Ye'' to be certified in the US. &&&&& &&&&& In popular culture &&&&& 070 Shake's appearance lead to a spike in people searching her name, as reported by ''Genius'', and her outro was praised across Twitter.

Haima 3 &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The '''Haima 3''' is a compact 4-door sedan produced in China from 2007 to 2013 under the Haima brand, a joint venture between the Hainan provincial government and Mazda. It was based on the same platform as the first generation Mazda 3 with a completely restyled body still heavily inspired by the Mazda 3. A 1.6 and 1.8 litre engine was available paired to a 5 speed manual or 6 speed CVT gearbox. The Haima 3 replaced the Haima Family sedan which is a rebadged Mazda 323 produced by Haima. However, the facelift model in 2011 was renamed to Haima Family again with prices ranging from 79,800 yuan to 84,800 yuan. &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& &&&&& * Haima official website &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

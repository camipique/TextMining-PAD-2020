327	Fawcett_Association
Fawcett Association &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& The '''Fawcett Association''' was a trade union representing postal clerks in London. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& The union was founded in 1890. It was named after Henry Fawcett, who it considered had been sympathetic to workers when he was Postmaster General. &&&&& &&&&& For most of its existence, the union's general secretary was Wallace Bligh Cheesman, and its chairman was William E. Clery. They were sacked from the Post Office after they circulated information about candidates in the 1892 UK general election, and attempted to get them to express support for the union. However, Cheesman remained the union's secretary throughout its existence. &&&&& &&&&& Cheesman decided to work closely with other unions, and in 1893, the Fawcett Association became the first clerical union to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress. It also joined the United Government Workers' Federation, and formed the National Joint Committee of Postal and Telegraph Associations in 1897, with the Postmen's Federation, Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association and United Kingdom Postal Clerks' Association. &&&&& &&&&& The union was represented at the founding meeting of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). Clery was adopted as an LRC candidate in 1901, but was also adopted as a Liberal-Labour candidate for Deptford. This proved controversial, and he did not ultimately stand under either label. &&&&& &&&&& Membership of the union grew steadily, reaching 3,750 by 1904. The Postal Bagmen's Association and the Women Sorters' Association affiliated to the Fawcett Association in 1906. In 1919, it merged with the Postmen's Federation and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association, forming the Union of Post Office Workers. &&&&& &&&&& Leadership &&&&& ===General Secretaries=== &&&&& :1889: L.

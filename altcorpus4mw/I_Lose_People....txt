While searching for a boat, they are attacked by gunfire from Martha, but she then falls unconscious due to her prior gunshot wound. Eventually, Alicia and Charlie find and use the SWAT vehicle to cross the lake and rescue Strand and John, with Martha tied up in the back. With no way of escaping from the roof and the streets below overrun with Infected, Morgan leads the group back to the generator room to search for Althea, where they find a note about her escape plan by using the freight elevator. The group escapes the hospital via the freight elevator, but Morgan stays behind to cause a distraction to clear their escape route. Morgan goes back to the roof and tosses an Infected corpse over, landing on a car and setting off its alarm. However, he is still stuck on the roof with a dying Jim. Alicia's group joins up with the others after getting their location over the walkie. They use a fire truck ladder to get Morgan off the roof. With little time left before he succumbs to his bite wound, Jim leaps from the roof onto a vehicle to set off its alarm and draw the Infected away from the others. Everyone gets inside the SWAT truck and realize Martha has vanished. Morgan suggests they find Althea and head to Virginia. That night back at the hospital, Martha watches Jim reanimate and takes him to go after Morgan. &&&&& &&&&& Reception &&&&& &&&&& Den of Geek rated the episode 3 out of 5 stars.

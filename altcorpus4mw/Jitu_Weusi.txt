He was born at St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn's P.S. 54 in 1952. As a young child he worked at his cousin's newsstand. He says, that from working at the newsstand he was introduced to jazz by the men that would frequent the newsstand. His cousins took him to his first jazz concert. &&&&& &&&&& His mother was involved in the local Parent Teachers Association (PTA). &&&&& While in his teens Jitu worked as a waiter at the Village Gate in New York City. While working at the Village Gate he met Thelonious Monk, and Nina Simone. &&&&& &&&&& He attended Brooklyn Tech High School, and Franklin Lane High School. &&&&& &&&&& Jitu received a basketball scholarship to attend Long Island University. &&&&& &&&&& Jitu wrote his thesis on the history of Black Swan Records, the first African American recording company. It was titled "The Rise and Fall of Black Swan Records." &&&&& &&&&& Career &&&&& In 1962 Jitu started working for the New York City Public schools. He taught Social Studies at Bedford–Stuyvesant's Junior High School (JHS 35). In March 1968 he was transferred to Junior High School 271 after taking students from his class to a Malcolm X memorial program. &&&&& &&&&& In the late 60s, Jitu left the New York City Department of Education, and started the Uhuru Sasa Shule private school, which means in Swahili (Freedom Now School). It was the first Black independent private school in New York City. The school was developed to address the need for African American students to understand their heritage and place in history. &&&&&  &&&&& He returned to teaching for Department of Education in NYC in 1985. He worked for many different schools for (DOE) for three decades. He retired in 2006. &&&&& &&&&& In 1968 Jitu played a significant role along with other young educators such as; Randy Tobias, Al Vann, Oliver Patterson, Leroy Lewis, Joan Eastman, and Ola Cherry for community control of public schools during the teachers strike in the fall of 1968. Which was known as the New York City teachers' strike of 1968. The strike pitted the United Federation of Teachers against community control of school advocates. The teacher's strike came after the new community-controlled school board dismissed white and Jewish American teachers. The United Federation of Teachers lead by Albert Shanker wanted and demanded that the teachers' be reinstated. It was a conflict between local rights and self-determination and the rights of teachers' universal rights as workers. &&&&& &&&&& It was one of the largest teachers' strikes in American history. In 1967 four out of 865 principals were Black, and 12 out of 1,500 were assistant principals in New York City schools. More than 95 perdent of the students in the public schools in the Ocean-Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn were Black and Latino and teachers were two-thirds white. During the 1968 strike over 500 New York City teachers went on strike. The strike lasted for 37 days, over a million students were affected by the strike. The strike came after controversy to integrate the public school system and community control with the school district called Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, Brownsville, Brooklyn. &&&&& &&&&& Prior to the teachers' strike was the Brown v. Board decision. This decision which called for the integration of the public school systems. The Brown v. Board of Education decision led to public school integration and busing. In New York City the effort to integration the public schools met with resistance and gridlock. In Harlem and in Ocean Hill-Brownsville an alternative to integration and rezoning was the demand for local community boards and parent control of schools. &&&&& &&&&& New York City Mayor John Lindsay in the spring of 1967 did grant "community control" to Ocean Hill-Brownsville and two other New York City neighborhoods. This was his response from White parents' complaints to busing to integrate schools. The New York City schools that were a part of the test experiment in community control of local schools were JHS 35, I.S. 201, and JHS 271. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Education (BOE) and supported by the Ford Foundation. The schools had a governing board of local parents and residents. Jitu described the community and teachers' movement as the “most underrepresented yet most impactful era of Brooklyn history.” And that the battle between, “the teachers and the community battled the Board of Education and the predominately-white United Federation of Teachers in a struggle that they hoped would finally create a structure for the empowerment of local communities. The result was the establishment of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Governing Board, a community school board that served central Brooklyn’s Black Community.” &&&&& &&&&& In 1968, Rhody McCoy was the unit administrator of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Demonstration School District project. He stated in a 1968 interview that the project of community control, and decentralization at the test schools were sabotaged by Albert Shanker, and the United Federation of Teachers. "We are convinced that the Establishment and this Society are determined to prevent blacks and Puerto Ricans from controlling their own schools." In regards to many of the white teachers that were removed; "Many of the teachers we removed were unfit. We didn't want them because they didn't think our kids were capable of learning." And that, " &&&&& community control over its schools--a right which belongs to every other community." &&&&& &&&&& In an interview with Julius Lester in 1968. Jitu explains that a poem written by a young African American student showed verbally how a student felt in regards to his teachers, which were not Jitu's view, but to demonstrate the feelings of a student. The poem was aired on WBAI in New York City, which created a lot of controversy, and Jitu was label anti-Jewish.

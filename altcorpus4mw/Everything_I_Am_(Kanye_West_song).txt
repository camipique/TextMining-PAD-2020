Everything I Am (Kanye West song) &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& "'''Everything I Am'''" is a song by American rap musician Kanye West that features DJ Premier, from West's third studio album ''Graduation'' (2007). &&&&& &&&&& Background &&&&& The track's chorus includes Kanye rapping the lyrics: "Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam", which is a true quote because he originally planned on giving this song's beat to Common, but the offer was met with rejection and West decided to rap on the beat himself. However, this doesn't mark the only time when Common passed on a beat for ''Graduation'', since he was originally offered the backing beat of "The Glory", before passing it on to West too. &&&&& &&&&& Composition &&&&& Multiple samples from the track "If We Can't Be Lovers" by Prince Phillip Mitchell are used throughout the song. It also samples vocals from Public Enemy's 1987 single "Bring the Noise". A third sample is used in "Everything I Am" of 1987 single "Jimbrowski" by Jungle Brothers. DJ Premier's feature on the track has him merely contributing scratches on the chorus. &&&&& &&&&& Lawsuit &&&&& There was controversy over the sample of "If We Can't Be Lovers" apparently being used without Mitchell's permission, with a lawsuit being fired against West for it in 2018, as well as one against Knowles for her track sampling "Everything I Am". &&&&& &&&&& Lyrical content &&&&& The verses feature West acknowledging that there's things he'll never be like, with quotes such as: "I'll never be as laid back as this beat was" and "Goodbye to the Indie Arie Award/". &&&&& &&&&& In an ''XXL'' list of 20 times the rap star showed Chicago love via lyrics, the lines: "You see how I creeped up?/You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?" made the list. &&&&& &&&&& Critical reception &&&&& ''NME'' gave a rather deep, but positive reception towards the track, describing it as: 'starting on a war tack, but slowly softening, compassion slipping through the seams'. The song was received by ''DJBooth'' as being 'almost a character analysis' from West. &&&&& &&&&& ''HotNewHipHop'' placed it at number 30 on their list of West's 50 best songs. &&&&& &&&&& Usage in media &&&&& American singer Solange sampled the song in her 2010 single "Fuck the Industry", which Kanye himself produced. &&&&& &&&&& The line "Everything I'm not made me everything I am" from it was quoted by rapper Mwana FA in his 2009 track "Naongea Na Wewe", which features fellow rapper A.Y., and G-Eazy in his 2011 track "Endless Summer". The same line, along with the line "Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam", that comes before it, was sampled but changed slightly in rapper Novel's 2014 track "There Are No Words". &&&&& &&&&& Live performances &&&&& On September 29, 2007, just over two weeks after the album featuring it had been released, West gave a freestyle over an orchestral version of the beat from "Everything I Am" live on ''SNL'', accompanied by a live performance of fellow ''Graduation'' track "Champion". &&&&& &&&&& Legacy &&&&& 10 years after the song had been officially released, DJBooth published an article about it being West's 'last comfortable moment', showing a view towards the track of it having a significant legacy. A legacy was also portrayed of "Everything I Am" in a 2017 article by Noisey about the featuring album, with it being written that the hook: 'became an almost ubiquitous Myspace screen name for teens and college-age kids' and that 'Those kids are now the biggest stars in rap and they haven't lost sight of the lessons Kanye taught on his genre-blending third album.', which shows it as having influence along with a legacy. &&&&& &&&&& In August 2016, Kim Kardashian West listed it among her top 28 favourite songs by her husband. &&&&& &&&&& Personnel &&&&& Information taken from ''Graduation'' liner notes. &&&&& *Songwriters: Kanye West, Phillip Mitchell, George Clinton, Jr., Carlton Ridenhour, Eric Sadler, Hank Shocklee &&&&& *Producers: Kanye West &&&&& *Recorders: Andrew Dawson, Anthony Kilhoffer &&&&& *Mix engineer: Mike Dean &&&&& *Assistant engineers: Bram Tobey, Jason Agel, Nate Hertweck, Anthony Palazzole, Andy Marcinowski &&&&& *Rhodes: Omar Edwards &&&&& *Additional vocals: Tony "Penafire" Williams &&&&& *Bass guitar: Vincent "Biggs" James &&&&& &&&&& References &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&

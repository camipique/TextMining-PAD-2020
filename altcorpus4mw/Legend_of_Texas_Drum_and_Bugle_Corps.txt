Legend of Texas Drum and Bugle Corps &&&&& Introduction &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& The logo of Legend of Texas. &&&&& '''Legend of Texas''' was a Division III DCI Corps from Lubbock, Texas active from 1998 to 2001. &&&&& &&&&& History &&&&& Legend was founded by Scott Puryear in 1998. The corps was established as a way for potential members in Western Texas to march a drum corps without having to travel large distances to march. The corps was established by a board of directors who had previously marched in drum corps. They had nearly a combined total of 35 years drum corps experience. &&&&& &&&&& One of the goals of the board was to provide a positive experience in the same manner the founding members had with their drum corps experiences. The uniforms, music, and show concepts would reflect the influences of Texas with the corps. &&&&& &&&&& In 1999, Legend was made a part of the DCI Pacific Division. They were the 16th corps to be a part of the circuit and the first one located east of the Rockies. &&&&& &&&&& The corps entered DCI as a Division III corps. The corps fielded a hornline of 10, a grounded percussion of 4, a color guard of 5, and 1 Drum Major. The show chosen was based on local rock legend Buddy Holly. The music consisted of the music of Buddy Holly and Don McLean's epic song "American Pie". After a limited tour schedule, they performed at the DCI Division III Prelims, placing a solid 15th place out of 31 corps. &&&&& &&&&& In 2000, the corps picked a completing Western theme for the show. Through the use of various pieces of music, the corps presented the day in the life of a cowboy. The show even utilized a saloon in the middle of the field. The corps marched a larger corps with a hornline of 12, a color guard of 3, a drumline of 12 (4P/3S/1Q/4B), and 1 Drum Major. The show was considerably more difficult and ambitious than the previous year. After a significantly longer tour than the previous year, Legend placed 15th at Division III Prelims with a 73.150. &&&&& &&&&& Unfortunately, the corps was unable to financially field a corps the next year. The corps ended up folding as a result. At the time the corps went inactive, plans were in place for a Legend of Texas winterguard and winter drumline to compete at Winter Guard International in 2001, as well as a brass ensemble to perform at local events and venues through the winter season &&&&& &&&&& Show Summary &&&&& ''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& Year &&&&& &&&&& Theme &&&&& &&&&& Repertoire &&&&& &&&&& Score &&&&& &&&&& Placement &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 1999 &&&&& &&&&& '''RAVE ON: The Life and Times of Buddy Holly''' &&&&& &&&&& Selections by Buddy Holly * American Pie &&&&& &&&&& 75.000 &&&&& &&&&& 15th Division III &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2000 &&&&& &&&&& '''DESPERADO: A Day In the Life of a Cowboy''' &&&&& &&&&& Desperado * The Ballad of Billy the Kid * Lonesome Dove * A Lil' Ole Bitty Pissant Country Place (from The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas) * The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly * City Slickers &&&&& &&&&& 73.150 &&&&& &&&&& 15th Division III &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& 2001 &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&&  ''Corps inactive'' &&&&& &&&&&  &&&&& &&&&& ''Did not attend'' &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& External links &&&&& * Drum Corps International &&&&& * &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&& &&&&&
